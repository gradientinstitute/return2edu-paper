  Pursuing formal retraining or an additional educational degree may constitute an important ingredient in the the late-career entrepreneurial path, provide a bridge to later retirement and/or increase earnings in later-career. We focus on the causal impacts to economic returns of degrees completed later in
  life, where motivations and capabilities to acquire additional education may
  be distinct from education in early years. We revisit this long-studied question with new methodological techniques by adapting machine learning models for causal inference. We find that completing an additional degree increases the probability of being self-employed by 1-2 percentage points and leads to more than \$3000 (AUD, 2019) per year compared to
  those who do not complete additional study in later-life. For outcomes, treatment and
  controls we use the extremely rich and nationally representative longitudinal
  data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey. 
  To take full advantage of the complexity and richness of these
  data we use a Machine Learning (ML) based methodology to estimate the causal
  effect. We are also able to use ML to discover sources of heterogeneity in
  the effects of gaining additional qualifications.

\section{Introduction}


Later-career entrepreneurship has been found to extend careers, provide job autonomy and flexibility \citep{hundley2001}, improve health \citep{stephan2010}, increase life satisfaction \citep{parker2007, kautonen2017, lombard2001}, and lift earnings \citep{levine2017, astebro2014}. Such benefits can also improve individuals’ retirement security by delaying pension claiming and increasing savings for retirement \citep{kibler2012}, as well as provide societal benefits via government budget savings in pension payouts and welfare programs \citep{herneas2016, kautonen2017}. On the other hand, later-career entrepreneurship may have costly barriers to entry, such as the need to obtain an additional qualification. The transition into entrepreneurship can not only take longer than expected, but can present obstacles (age-discrimination) and compete with other commitments (such as caring responsibilities) \citep{kibler2012, weber2004}. For later-career entrepreneurship to be individually rewarding and socially sustainable it is important to understand which transition pathways elevate entrepreneurial and financial success, and which transition pathways tend to be counter-productive.

In this paper we ask:~does formal retraining or upskilling constitute an important ingredient in the late-career entrepreneurial path? And if so, is it economically rewarding for individuals to undertake such formal retraining or upskilling? We also aim to understand which individuals generate higher versus lower returns to formal retraining and upskilling. Specifically, which factors explain the relationship between formal retraining and later-life economic and entrepreneurial success. We depart from the returns to education literature by focusing on education at older ages (25 and over) as opposed to early adulthood. We focus on retraining and upskilling by studying individuals who return to formal education\footnote{We focus on formally recognised degrees ranging from short degrees (6 months to 2 years full-time) to postgraduate degrees such as masters and PhDs. Most degrees undertaken in our sample are Certificate 3 or 4 degrees which take an average of 1-2 years to complete. See Figure 5 for the breakdown of the type of formal degrees considered.} after a break from education acquired in early adulthood. In other words, we focus on degrees that are additional to the first educational degree obtained. 

Despite the increasing prevalence of formal retraining or upskilling, this is an understudied topic in both the education and entrepreneurship literature. Until now the literature has focused on the cumulative years of education or early-years educational attainment, such as college or high school degrees. We argue that there is value in focusing on the impact of \textit{re}training separately from cumulative education years, especially since returns to education are more uncertain for older students who face higher opportunity costs and complex entry rules. This also allows us to disentangle formal retraining and upskilling from experience in the workforce (or through, for example, volunteering pursuits). This is an important distinction since there is likely a trade-off between these two ingredients in entrepreneurial success \citep{zacharakis2000}. By doing so we contribute to the strand of literature that examines the human capital impacts on entrepreneurship \citep{unger2011}. 

Despite the significant increase in the uptake of degrees in later life \citep{oecd2016}, it is unclear, a-priori, if formal retraining and upskilling is an entrepreneurial and economically rewarding endeavour. On the one hand, investing in education in later life may be a promising pathway to starting a business. For example, it may assist individuals to update skills that technological change and automation may demand \citep{autor2008, acemoglu2011} or help them to retrain in new skills if self-employment involves an occupational pivot. For others, the transition into entrepreneurship from unemployment may require some formal retraining or upskilling due to their disconnection from the workforce. Older individuals who wish to start a business (after the age of 40) may be more likely to face technology-driven erosion of skills, compared to younger individuals, which creates a greater need for retraining. However, older individuals may not reap the full rewards of retraining as they have less time to accrue gains from educational investment. While the literature finds strong positive returns to education for skilled entrepreneurs \citep{fossen2013}\footnote{The returns are estimated to be higher for opportunity entrepreneurs (those who voluntarily start their own business) versus necessity entrepreneurs (those who lack alternative employment options). We do not make this distinction because the sample size of older entrepreneurs is already small.} and for college degree completion following secondary school \citep{jacobson2005, chesters2015, zeidenberg2015, polidano2016, xu2016, belfield2017, dynarski2016, dynarski2018, mountjoy2022}, the returns for older individuals are unclear given the trade-offs associated with retraining. 

On the other hand, obtaining an additional education in later life can have large opportunity costs in terms of forgone experience and earnings \citep{haber2007, montgomery2006} and these ingredients may be more important to entrepreneurial success \citep{zhao2021, weber2004}. The financial and time constraints of retraining and upskilling are also likely to be higher in later life than during adolescence\footnote{\cite{abel2014} estimate forgone earnings of a 4-year college degree to be around \$23,000 (2013 USD) while \cite{montgomery2006} estimate forgone earnings of an MBA, a graduate management program, to be higher at around \$28,000 (2013 USD).}, which can explain why drop-out rates among mature-age learners is relatively high \citep{cherastidtham2018, hanson2022, guerra2022}. The costs of financing education, such as higher debt, can itself hinder entrepreneurship \citep{krishnan2019}. The type of retraining is also relevant. Entrepreneurial specific educational programs may have little impact on students' own self-assessed proficiency of their entrepreneurial skills and can even have a negative impact on their intention to be an entrepreneur \citep{oosterbeek2010}. Thus, for later-life educational attainment to be a worthwhile endeavour, a key unanswered question is whether it is economically rewarding for individuals. 

This paper contributes to addressing this gap in knowledge by estimating the causal effect of formal retraining and upskilling on earnings and entrepreneurship. We define entrepreneurship as `becoming' self-employed in later life. This includes individuals who transition from being an employee or non-employed to being self-employed after the age of 40 versus those who (1) remain employees, (2) remain self-employed, or (3) remain non-employed. We compare the entrepreneurial success and earnings of individuals who undertook formal retraining after the age of 25 (our treated group) with those who did not obtain a further degree after the age of 25 (our control group). Our retraining variable is defined before entry into entrepreneurship, which overcomes possible reverse causation~\citep{cassar2006}. 

Our causal and heterogeneity analysis utilises, at the outset, every piece of background information that is asked about an individual\footnote{Variables included span from information about their family and neighbourhood to the individual's intention to change job or industry, predicted retirement age, caring responsibilities, financial debt, economic circumstances, demographic characteristics and the earnings trajectories prior to retraining.} in a rich, nationally representative survey dataset. Effectively, we begin with over 3,400 characteristics or features about the individual, which enables a stronger like-for-like comparison of treated and control groups, as well as deeper insights into how the estimated returns to formal retraining and upskilling may vary by background or circumstance. Specifically, we use 19 waves of nationally representative panel data (from 2001-2019) from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA) survey. Our empirical strategy is to adapt Machine Learning (ML) techniques for the aim of causal analysis. We need to adapt these tools because they are traditionally used for predictive purposes. The three key benefits of the ML approach over traditional methods is (1) it effectively acts as a hyper-propensity-matching technique that utilises as much information as possible to construct similar groups of individuals in the treated and control groups; (2) it systematically reduces information redundancy between variables that are highly correlated, so it addresses overfitting issues; and (3) it identifies new sub-populations for which the treatment effects are different, which means we avoid missing out on important heterogeneities that may arise from pre-specifying sub-groups \citep{athey2017, knaus2021}.
We use the ML approach combined with the full power of an incredibly rich survey dataset to overcome the main challenge in estimating the causal returns to formal retraining and upskilling: selection. The factors that enable or motivate mature-age learners to pursue and complete retraining or upskilling may also be independent precursors to later-life earnings or entrepreneurial success. For example, those who intend to enter entrepreneurship in later life may invest more in retraining themselves for the role. Alternatively, previous studies have found that individuals who seek a further community college degree tend to have slower growing earnings in the period before their study starts compared to similar individuals who do not seek further study \citep{jacobson2005, dynarski2016, dynarski2018}. 

A key empirical contribution of this paper is that we adapt ML tools for causal inference purposes. We recognise that, as with all statistical models, we make assumptions when we use ML techniques for causal inference, and these need to be tested. We test the assumption that the additional controls included in the ML models work to address selection-into-treatment issues described above. First, we replicate the results based on published works by \cite{chesters2015}. Then we contrast the `systematically' selected control variables in the ML model with those that were manually selected in the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model by \cite{chesters2015}, and comment on the potential biases from manual variable selection. We have chosen this published work because it uses the same data (HILDA) and examines the same topic. Second, we compare the results of the ML model with models traditionally used to address unobserved heterogeneity such as a Fixed Effects Difference-in-Difference approach. Across all results, we find that the ML models tend to estimate lower returns to retraining compared to these baseline models.

Human capital theory, employment choice theory, and self-determination theory provide valuable frameworks for examining the impact of retraining and upskilling on earnings and entrepreneurship. Human capital theory \citep{becker1964} recognises that acquiring additional education can improve human capital -- an individuals' skills and knowledge -- which can enhance productivity and earnings potential. Individuals who engage in retraining and upskilling may acquire new competencies and knowledge that positively impact their suitability for entrepreneurship. Employment choice theory \citep{heckman1993} suggests that retraining and upskilling can influence an individuals' choice to pursue entrepreneurship through the acquisition of new perspectives, specialized knowledge, and expanded networks. It emphasises that the choice of employment type is influenced by a range of factors, such as personal preferences, skills, motivation, financial considerations, and opportunities for growth and fulfilment. Self-determination theory \citep{deci1985} reflects on the psychological needs that promote well-being. Retraining and upskilling that supports autonomy, aligns with personal goals, and provides a sense of competence can provide individuals with the confidence, skills, and motivation necessary to pursue higher-paying positions or start their own business. These theories highlight the complex dynamics involved in later-life education and its potential outcomes for individuals' economic prospects and entrepreneurial pursuits, such as the interplay between human capital investment, individual motivation and personal preferences. 

Our results show that an additional degree in later life increases the probability of being self-employed (at age 40 or older) by 1-2 percentage points and increases total future earnings by more than \$3,000 (AUD) per year on average, compared to those who do not complete further study. We consistently estimate this causal effect using a selection-on-observables strategy based on T-learner, Doubly Robust and Bayesian models. As entrepreneurship is a binary variable, we also use Logit and Probit transformations to model the non-linearity in parameters. 

Our ML approach also identifies new sub-populations for which the treatment effects are different. For entrepreneurship, we document that behavioural factors, such as the age at which a person left home and the division of labour in the household, are the most significant factors related to benefits from retraining. Household income is also hugely important: those with above median household income tend to benefit more from retraining than those with below median household income. This aligns with the entrepreneur literature that finds higher household income prior to becoming self-employed is associated with more ambitious revenue targets \citep{cassar2006}. For earnings, the most significant factors affecting returns to retraining are the starting levels of and pre-study trends in personal and household income. Age and wealth-related variables also account for variation in estimated effects. All of these variables are consistently selected as being significant for prediction out of the 3,400 features within the HILDA data. This selection is consistent across different ML models (which includes linear and non-linear model classes) and across numerous bootstrap draws of the original sample. 



%Pursuing educational qualifications later in life is an increasingly common
%phenomenon within OECD countries \citep{oecd2016}. Technological change and
%automation continues to drive the evolution of skills needed in many
%professions, or to oust the human workforce in others. This is particularly
%true for middle-income workers performing routine tasks
%\citep{autor2008,acemoglu2011}. Also at the lower end of the
%income-distribution, such as among welfare recipients, governments are
%increasingly trying to promote the idea of life-long learning.
%
%This paper contributes to understanding the efficacy of these decisions made by governments and individuals to pursue mature-age learning by estimating the causal effect on earnings. Our paper expands on the education literature, which has focused mainly on younger students, by estimating the returns to older cohorts. Previous research points to positive and significant wage premiums for younger cohorts with more education, ranging between 5 and 15\% \citep{angrist1991, harmon2003, machin2006, harmon1995}. The wage returns to education may be more uncertain for older students as they face higher opportunity costs to study and need to navigate a more fragmented system in the post-secondary education setting. Wage premiums from vocational and community college education are also found to be strong and positive \citep{jacobson2005, chesters2015, zeidenberg2015, polidano2016, xu2016, belfield2017, dynarski2016, dynarski2018, mountjoy2022}, particularly for female students \citep{belfield2017, zeidenberg2015, perales2017}. The effects are even stronger after accounting for earnings growth prior to enrolment, as workers who earn awards tend to have flatter earnings growth prior to enrolment \citep{dynarski2016, dynarski2018}. 
%
%Focusing on one institutional setting i.e. community college may not be generalisable to the entire mature-age education market, as these students seek a range of degree types and institutions \citep{belfield2017model, mountjoy2022}. We contribute to this literature by estimating the returns across all degree-types (post-graduate degrees, training certificates, diplomas
%etc.), spanning all subjects and institutions. As a result, we cover students with a wider set of demographic and socio-economic background characteristics. The broad remit of students that we analyse also allows our study to compliment research that evaluates government-run training programs, which tend to enrol low-productivity workers \citep{ashenfelter1978, ashenfelter1985, bloom1990, leigh1990, raaum2002, jacobson2005, card2018, knaus2022}. 
%
%We contribute the first evidence in systematically identifying which groups of
%mature-age students tend to benefit more from further education. We also
%compliment previous studies that already find significant heterogeneity by
%degree-type, institutional setting, and by the background characteristics of
%the student \citep{blanden2012, zeidenberg2015, polidano2016, dorsett2016, xu2016,
%belfield2017,perales2017, bockerman2019}. A benefit of a systematic,
%data-driven approach to heterogeneity analysis is that it can reduce the risk
%of overlooking important sub-populations compared to less data-driven
%approaches \citep{athey2017, knaus2021}. 
%
%A key challenge in estimating the causal returns to later-life education is
%that factors that enable mature-age learners to pursue and complete a
%qualification may also be precursors to later-life success. Moreover, the
%drivers of degree completion may be numerous and related to other variables in
%complex, unknown ways. We use a machine learning (ML) based methodology which allows us to intensively control for many confounding factors, as
%well as discover sources of treatment heterogeneity. ML algorithms also
%automatically discover non-linear relationships that may be unknown to the
%researcher. For high-dimensional and complex datasets such as ours, these methodological abilities are crucial in reducing bias from model mis-specification and confounding (e.g. selection into
%treatment), and reducing variance from correlation/collinearity.  
%
%We adapt ML tools for causal inference purposes. We recognise that, as with all statistical models, we make assumptions when we use ML techniques for causal inference, and these need to be tested. We test the assumption that the controls included in the ML models sufficiently account for selection into treatment with a replication exercise. We compare the results of the ML model with baseline models using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Fixed Effects. We also contrast the selected control variables in the ML model with those that were manually selected in \cite{chesters2015}, and comment on the potential biases from manual variable selection. We have chosen this published work because it uses the same data (HILDA) and examines the same topic.
%
%The results show that an additional degree in later-life increases total future
%earnings by more than \$3,000 per year on average compared to those who do
%not complete further study. We consistently estimate this causal effect
%using a selection-on-observables strategy based on T-learner, Doubly Robust and
%Bayesian models. The estimate is based on 19 years of detailed nationally
%representative Australian data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics
%Australia (HILDA) survey. Two dimensions of these data are important. The first
%is that they contain a wealth of information about each respondent. For
%example, we begin with more than 3,400 variables per observation, including
%information about the respondents' demographic and socio-economic background,
%and on their attitudes and preferences. Access to this broad range of
%information means that by controlling for them, we can potentially proxy for
%unobservable differences between those who do and do not obtain a new
%qualification. Secondly, this dataset contains many variables that are highly
%correlated, so we require a systematic approach to reduce such information
%redundancy -- something that ML models are adept at.
%
%Our ML approach also identifies new sub-populations for which the treatment
%effects are different. We document that the starting home loan amount and
%employment aspirations are significant factors related to the extent of gain
%from further study. We also find that the starting levels of and pre-study
%trends in personal and household income are hugely important. Age and mental
%health variables also account for variation in estimated effects. All of these
%variables are consistently selected as being significant for prediction out of
%the 3,400 features within the HILDA data. This selection is consistent across
%different ML models (which includes linear and non-linear model classes) and
%across numerous bootstrap draws of the original sample.
%
%Previous studies have found that individuals who seek a further degree tend to
%have slower-growing earnings in the period before their study starts compared
%to similar individuals who do not seek further study \citep{jacobson2005,
%dynarski2016, dynarski2018}. By accounting for dynamic selection into obtaining
%a further degree, we can be confident that we compare the earnings paths of
%mature-age students to the paths of similar non-students who displayed the same
%earnings (and other) paths before study began. In this paper, we explicitly
%control for the trajectories of socio-economic and demographic circumstances
%before study starts. Standard fixed effects estimation would miss these dynamic
%confounders. We find that our ML estimates are significantly smaller than the
%size of the standard fixed effects results. We also estimate lower returns
%compared to Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) models. We document the additional
%confounder variables that we include in our models but which are usually omitted from
%standard OLS specifications. These variables suggest there is significant
%selection into mature-age students who undertake a further degree.

% Understanding the different sources of dynamic selection is also important for
% heterogeneity analyses. This requires us to model the potential sources rather
% than eliminating them such as through controlling for individual-specific time
% trends. 

%
%Extending the analysis to other measurements of earnings, we find that further
%study can in fact reduces hourly wages We aim to estimate the causal impact of
%obtaining an educational qualification in later-life on earnings  
%
%
%Two other issues need further attention in the literature. The first relates
%to the measurement of earnings. Prior studies commonly analyse only measures
%of total earnings. This ignores the likelihood that further education may be
%sought in order to allow for more flexibility on the job such as in part-time
%work. This means that the value-add of further education on hourly wages may
%be obscured by a total earnings measure.
%
%The second issue relates to dynamic selection. 
%
%We fill the gaps in the literature by estimating the impact of further
%education on earnings (both total and hourly),  
%
%Another key contribution of our research is to systematically identify sources
%of static and dynamic heterogeneity in the estimated returns of further study.
%We use several Machine Learning approaches to identify heterogeneity,
%including the T-learner, Doubly Robust and Bayesian Linear models. These
%methods can also help to tackle the issue of selection bias and
%mis-specification error. Thus we also contribute to the literature that
%estimates the returns across a wider range of qualifications
%\citep{angrist1991,harmon1995,blanden2012,perales2017,bockerman2019}. 
%
%Machine learning methods may provide further insights into the causal question
%for a number of reasons. The first benefit of a data-driven approach is that
%it can generate a counterfactual group when we use observational data. A key
%challenge in estimating the causal returns to later-life education is that:
%what leads (or enables) mature-age learners to pursue and complete a
%qualification may itself be a precursor to later-life success. Moreover, the
%drivers of degree completion may be numerous and related to other variables in
%complex, unknown ways. A data-driven approach can systematically shed light on
%these unknowns. As a result, ML can help to reduce bias from selection into
%treatment. This is especially useful when appropriate instrumental variables
%are unavailable.
%
%We use a data-driven (permutation importance) procedure. This exercise can
%elucidate the potential mechanisms as well as inform different policy
%targeting and/or compensation strategies. 
%
%We argue that ML is well placed to achieve these benefits, especially since we
%apply it to extremely rich, nationally representative, longitudinal data. We
%use data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey. Two
%dimensions of these data are important. The first is that they contain a
%wealth of information about each respondent. For example, we begin with more
%than 3,400 variables per observation, including information about the
%respondents' demographic and socio-economic background, and on their attitudes
%and preferences. Using this broad range of information as control variables we
%can reduce selection bias issues, and potentially proxy for unobservable
%differences between those who do and do not obtain a new qualification.
%Secondly, this dataset contains many variables that are highly correlated and
%we require a systematic approach to reduce such information redundancy. 
%
%An ML approach can achieve these benefits because it can detect patterns and
%relationships, such as functional forms and control variables, that are
%unknown to the researcher. This assists with variable selection and with
%identifying meaningful sub-populations for which the effects differ.
%Furthermore, as ML models systematically choose control variables to minimise
%the amount of information redundancy between them, we can improve causal
%estimation parameters by reducing their variance.

%
% for which the returns to further education vary. Sub-group analysis is useful because it can inform us about potential mechanisms as well as inform different policy targeting and/ or compensation strategies. We use a permutation importance procedure to identify the key subgroups for which the effects vary the most.
%
%
% For example, mature-age students may undertake further study to change employers or careers or to improve their promotion prospects or earning capability. Such motivations can themselves lead to higher earnings in the future, regardless of degree completion. Furthermore, the benefits are likely to be unevenly distributed: some mature-age learners are more likely to benefit than others because of their degree-type, subject area, or background situation. What drives degree completion and who benefits more are complex, practical questions and not in themselves obvious to the researcher.
%
%A data-driven approach is thus appropriate to shed light on these unknowns. With the aim of causal inference in mind, we tailor Machine Learning (ML) models to examine the degree to which gaining a new qualification provides mature-age learners with economic (earnings and employment) and well-being (mental health and subjective well-being) benefits. We also examine which mature-age learners tend to reap more benefits than others. We use data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey, which combined with ML models, allow us to exploit the full set of background information on individuals (beginning with more than 3,400 variables per observation). Our ultimate aim is to better inform individuals, employers, and governments about the returns to educational investment, and thus improve the allocation of resources.
%
%We argue that a data-driven approach is useful to generate a plausible counterfactual when we use observational data. It is especially useful in our case because (1) the form of the confounding and its relationship to outcomes, are unclear, (2) we have access to large swathes of information per observation – variables that can help to minimise confounding but much of which is redundant because the variables are highly correlated, and (3) a-priori, it is unclear which groups of individuals may benefit more or less from an additional qualification. The benefit of a data-driven approach is that it can detect patterns and relationships, such as functional forms and control variables, that are unknown to the researcher, which assists with variable selection and with identifying meaningful sub-populations for which the effects differ. Furthermore, as ML models systematically choose control variables to minimise the amount of information redundancy between them, we can improve causal estimation parameters (both in terms of bias and variance).
%
%Over the last few decades, education-economics researchers have made several innovations in minimising confounding bias, including implementing fixed effects estimation (especially including person-specific linear trends) \citep{dynarski2018,wang2018,perales2017,xu2016,polidano2016,zeidenberg2015,jacobson2005} instrumental variables \citep{harmon1999,card1999,card1995,ashenfelter1997,angrist1991}, and regression discontinuity designs \citep{melguizo2016,jacob2004,duchini2017}. These approaches, in order to be implemented, require specific sources of variation or datasets with a large number of observations (in order to estimate person-specific linear time trends for example). However, researchers often lack these attributes in their data. In this paper, we take a different approach to minimising confounding bias.

%We use an automated feature selection process. We begin with a dataset containing an enormous amount of information per observation. Specifically, we leverage all the information available to us in a rich nation-based survey data set, beginning with 3,400 untransformed variables. Many of these variables are highly correlated with each other. 
%
%Data-driven feature selection has its benefits and drawbacks. A key benefit is that ML models are well-placed to reduce information redundancy across variables in a feature set, which is prevalent when there are many variables per observation – and when these variables are highly correlated. An ML approach will identify variables in the dataset with the highest predictive power. An additional benefit is that among the subset of identified variables, ML can include those that have been previously overlooked by theory-based approaches to variable selection. In our case, our subset of ML-selected variables includes those that theory readily articulates to be important determinants as well as those that have been previously ignored. Including such variables can thus reduce total bias in the estimates. In addition, how some variables relate to the outcome may have little theoretical premise such as those with non-linear functional forms. Again, an ML-approach to feature selection can address this unknown and thus reduce misspecification error.
%
%A drawback of a data-driven feature selection approach is that it can be a black-box. For example, an ML-algorithm can randomly choose features if there is a high degree of correlation between them. As such, interpretability can be difficult. This is particularly problematic when we look at heterogeneity analysis and use ML to determine where the treatment effects are most different. In estimating the Average Treatment Effects, the features act a nuisance parameters, aiding the prediction of the outcome equations. In such circumstances, the randomness in the selection process matters less.
%
%In summary, our data-driven approach can select features or control variables that minimise confounding bias while minimising overfitting issues. Thus, we can reduce total error in the effect estimates. Thus, taking a ML-approach to estimating causal parameters is the first contribution of our work to the Economics of Education literature.
%Our data-driven approach complements existing econometric methods. The ML models we employ utilise other sources of variation and make other assumptions about the nature of confounding. Specifically, our ML models can address unobservable confounding if components of observable characteristics, or flexible combinations of them, can proxy for unobservable characteristics. Although we use observable characteristics to account for confounding in unprecedented detail, unobservable confounding issues may remain. To explore the degree to which unobservable confounding may be a problem, we compare the effect estimates from our machine learning models with those derived from fixed effects (FE) estimation. FE models account for a particular form of unobservable confounding (time-constant unobservable factors) by exploiting other dimensions of variation in the data and by making different assumptions. By examining the intersection between econometric and machine learning causal models, we aim to provide a better understanding of the nature of the confounding issue.
%
%A second contribution of our work is our approach to inference. We argue that the procedure we use has enormous value for studies that rely on survey-based data, which tends to be smaller is sample size. 
%A common approach to inference in the causal machine learning literature is to use sample splitting (Athey and Wager 2019). Sample splitting ensures that the standard errors on the estimators are not underestimated because it avoids using the same data point to both select the configuration (hyperparameter selection) of the model and to estimate the parameters. When the same data point is used to perform both tasks then the standard errors would not reflect both the uncertainty stemming from model selection and that which stems from estimating parameters on noisy, finite data. The result of this is that our standard errors suffer from pre-test bias: i.e. selecting the model with the same data you use to estimate the model, which can lead to overfitting.
%However, sample splitting is appropriate when the sample size is large. An issue with our paper, and indeed many studies that rely on survey-based data, is that sample sizes are not large enough to perform sample splitting. Our sample size is not sufficiently large because we do not have enough data to split the dataset into train and test datasets where each of these splits would cover all the common and uncommon values of the X-covariates that are observed in the full sample. If we were to use a training dataset that was insufficiently sized or non-representative, it would be difficult for the ML models to effectively map the X-covariates to the outcome surfaces, µ1(x) and µ0(x). There would also not be enough data in the test set to effectively estimate the parameters of the model configuration chosen in the train set. As a result, our estimate treatment effects are likely to be very imprecisely estimated. 
%A suitable alternate procedure is to use bootstrapping. Resampling gives us a decent estimate on how the point estimates might vary. In this way, we side-step the need to rely on the assumption of asymptotical normality (and we do not need to utilise sample splitting to generate the standard errors). In our bootstrapping procedure, we ensure that the standard errors reflect the sources of uncertainty stemming from ‘both’ the selection of the model and the estimation of the model. As a result, we generate standard errors that avoid any potential pre-test issues. 
%
%
%A third contribution of our work is that we identify the sub-populations for which the estimated treatment effect may vary the most. Traditionally, economists have relied on theory or past experience to identify these groups and generate heterogeneous treatment effects. Yet this approach risks overlooking some sub-populations for which the returns to further education vary. Sub-group analysis is useful because it can inform us about potential mechanisms as well as inform different policy targeting and/ or compensation strategies. We use a permutation importance procedure to identify the key subgroups for which the effects vary the most.
%
%A fourth contribution of our work is that we can identify features that may have been previously overlooked or unanticipated. One way that researchers have addressed confounding issues is to manually select a set of controls, informed by theory and/or past empirical studies. However, as much of the discussions of best practice in empirical research or theory pertains to assessing the returns to education for younger students (who have had little workforce experience) \citep{mincer1974}, it is unclear if this knowledge is generalisable to mature-age students. Furthermore, using a data-driven approach to examine heterogeneous treatment effects can allow researchers to identify meaningful sub-groups that they may not have previously considered.

%We adapt ML models for the purpose of estimating causal effects. Standard
%off-the-shelf ML models are better suited to predictive purposes. When
%obtaining a prediction, off-the-shelf ML models can find generalisable patterns
%and minimise overfitting issues through the use of cross-validation because
%the true outcomes are observed. This means that we can optimize a
%goodness-of-fit criterion. Causal parameters, however, are not observed in the
%data, which means we cannot directly train and evaluate our models. 
%
%In this paper, we take the difference between the two optimal outcome models
%which can achieve the optimum bias-variance trade-off point for the conditional
%average treatment effect. Specifically, we model the response surfaces for two
%conditional mean equations -- one using the treatment observations and another
%using the control observations. We estimate these equations with ML methods
%such as the T-learner and Doubly Robust. Here, we employ both linear (LASSO and
%Ridge) and non-linear (Gradient Boosted Regression) model classes. We compare
%and evaluate their comparative performance using nested cross-validation. We
%then test the statistical significance of our causal parameters by examining
%the distribution of the estimates through bootstrapping. Last, we use a variety
%of Bayesian ML models following the formulation presented in \citet{hahn2020}
%that reduce effect estimation bias within the Bayesian paradigm. These models
%have several properties that may be desirable, such as the ability to directly
%parameterise heterogeneous prognostic and treatment models.

%
%A benefit of our set-up is that when we take the difference between the two optimal outcome models, we coincidently find the optimum bias-variance trade-off point for the conditional average treatment effect.  
%
%We use a range of ML-based techniques. The first is the T-learner approach. This involves estimating two separate outcome surfaces – one that maps out the relationship between the features and the outcome using the Treated observations and another that does this using the control observations. By estimating two separate surfaces, we allow the features to flexibly relate to the outcome and to do so differently across the Treated and Control groups. 
%
%The second approach is Doubly Robust.  A benefit here is that we use additional information from the propensity score (we employ machine learning models to gain a better understanding of the treatment assignment process, the students’ background, and the nature and complexity of their situation that may have led them to pursue further education). Thus, the doubly robust approach can improve upon the T-learner approach because it can reduce misspecification error EITHER through a correctly specified propensity score model or through correctly specified outcome equations. Another feature of the Doubly Robust approach is that it places a higher weight on observations in the area where the relative count of treatment and control observations is more balanced (i.e. the area of overlap). A benefit of this is that it can also provide better extrapolations of the predicted outcomes.  
%
%A third approach is to use Bayes theory. The key benefits of estimating Bayesian models are..…  \color{red} Dan, can you please give a basic summary of the Bayesian approach and the benefits of using it. \color{black}

%\section{Literature review}
%
%Much of the causal research on the returns to education for younger cohorts was conducted in the 1990’s, some of which relies on data collected in earlier decades. The results show positive and significant wage premiums for those with more education, ranging between 5 and 13\% \citep{machin2006}. While these studies employ a range of techniques to isolate the impact of education on earnings, endogeneity issues have been identified in many of them i.e., twin studies do not necessarily control for ability, and instrumental variables tend to have weak exclusion restrictions \citep{harmon2003}. The more recent literature focuses on improving the estimation methods, but still relies on data from the previous decade or earlier. Despite the large body of work on this topic, the causal evidence on the return to education in the current era is lacking. Drawing on the available research, two studies stand out. \cite{angrist1991} use variation in compulsory school age across US states between 1960 and 1980 to show that those with more schooling, by virtue of reaching the dropout age later in the year, earn more. Using IV estimation to exploit this natural experiment, they place the return to education at 6-11\%. Their findings are based on Census data from 1980 where their sample of men were aged between 30 and 50. \cite{harmon1995} use the same instrument for education in the UK, which also saw changes in the compulsory school leaving age laws during the 1950’s and 1970’s. Using data on employed men aged between 18 and 64 over the years 1978 and 1986, they estimate the return to education to be more than 15\%. Both studies focus on young cohorts, with the variation in the minimum school age ranging from 14 to 18 years. Our paper expands on this literature by looking at older cohorts.
%
%In comparison, the evidence on the returns to post-secondary education has grown enormously since the 1990’s, spurred on by the availability of linked administrative data on student records and earnings. The transition from cross-sectional data to longitudinal data helped to resolve some of the selection bias associated with comparing those with a qualification to those without, as concerns over motivation, ability and other unobserved time-invariant characteristics can be controlled with an individual fixed-effects model. However, some selection bias remains as fixed-effects models cannot fully account for the fact that individuals who expect their prospects to improve by gaining a new qualification ‘select into’ education.
%
%Vocational and community college degrees have received particular attention in the literature since they tend to attract returning students who have employment earnings prior to attaining a new qualification. This has allowed researchers to compare individuals’ earnings before and after a qualification, and to compare the size of this change between students who receive a qualification and those who leave without one. In addition, since students enrolled in sub-bachelor programs are disproportionately low-income and low-performing students, the absence of individual characteristics in cross-sectional samples can bias the estimated returns downward \citep{xu2016}. Studies that compare individual fixed-effects methods with cross-sectional methods using the same sample find opposing effects. Fixed-effects methods show positive returns while cross-sectional methods show negative returns, suggesting that individual fixed-effects models can capture biases resulting from omitted time-invariant characteristics \citep{xu2016}. In the absence of prior earnings histories, researchers have exploited the student records and earnings of non-completers, as they are a more valid control group for those with qualifications, as opposed to secondary school graduates who never attend TAFE/college. The use of student records has also allowed researchers to disaggregate the effects by length, field of study and type of qualification. Associate degrees in nursing and health tend to yield the highest returns \citep{zeidenberg2015,xu2016}. While these methods may still suffer from some selection bias – related to potential unobservable differences between those who choose to leave versus stay in their degree – the results have proved to be highly robust and minimally biased \citep{zeidenberg2015}. Based on these new data and methods, the evidence on the labour market returns to vocational and community college education is strong and positive, particularly for female students \citep{belfield2017,zeidenberg2015,perales2017}.
%
%
%
%\cite{dynarski2018} and \cite{jacobson2005} extend on these methods by adding individual time-trends, so as to account for time-varying unobserved heterogeneity between students. By doing this they test the common-trends assumption that underlies the individual fixed-effects estimation strategy. \cite{dynarski2016} and \cite{dynarski2018} show that accounting for time-trends increases the return to associate degrees by as much as 25\% because it can identify that workers who earn awards tend to have flatter earnings growth prior to enrolment. \cite{dynarski2018} apply this to US community college records in 2003-2004 and earnings data in 2011. They estimate earnings gains of \$10,000 per year for associate degree holders and \$3,200 per year for certificate holders, placing their estimates at the high end of the range in the literature.
%
%Australian and British research shows that significant earnings gains can be achieved when returning students acquire qualifications above those held previously, and when they are acquired at younger ages \citep{polidano2016,dorsett2016,perales2017}. Lower or equivalent level qualifications, or qualifications earned closer to age 40, are associated with smaller or insignificant returns.
%
%\cite{perales2017} use Australian longitudinal data between 2001 and 2015 to estimate a fixed-effects model on individuals who obtained a higher-order qualification between ages 25 and 63. The largest wage gains were associated with acquiring an undergraduate degree, either from a secondary school diploma (Year 12) or post-secondary certificate or diploma, of between 10-23\% for men and 15-18\% for women. Similarly substantial wage gains were associated with moves from undergraduate to post-graduate degrees of around 15\% for men and 10\% for women. Only modest gains were associated with transitions from less than Year 12 to a certificate or diploma, for both men (5.9\%) and women (3.9\%). While the differences between men and women were not found to be statistically significant, there was weak evidence that only men benefit from the transition from Year 12 to a certificate or diploma. This shows that not all qualification advancements benefit Australian workers in the same way.
%
%\cite{polidano2016} explore vocational education in more depth using the same data and methods as \cite{perales2017}. Instead of aggregating sub-bachelor qualifications together, \cite{polidano2016} assess each level individually. They found that women who acquire any certificate (level 1-4) after Year 12 showed the largest increase in wages, of about 10\%. Men, on the other hand, experienced similar wage gains by acquiring a certificate 3, 4 or diploma without Year 12. In short, men do not increase their earnings by completing Year 12 first. In general, women showed larger improvements in labour market outcomes following the completion of a vocational qualification. However, qualifications that were not of higher order did not generate benefits. The effects remained 5 years after course completion and suggest strong long-term benefits to vocational education. By comparison, when \cite{polidano2016} analyse the data as pooled cross-sections they found the returns to be around half the size of the fixed effects estimates. However, men showed substantially smaller returns when gaining a university degree in the fixed effects model while women showed similar returns when gaining sub-bachelor qualifications. In general, though, the cross-sectional results doubled the estimated earnings effects, but they also switched which gender benefited most. The fixed effects estimates showed larger qualification effects for women, supporting the general finding in the literature.
%
%\cite{zeidenberg2015} link community college non-completers with completers according to their field of study to identify differences in their labour market returns. Based on the finding by Jacobson et al. (2005) that non-completers can achieve earnings gains from as little as one semester of credits, \cite{zeidenberg2015} question whether all credits are equally rewarding i.e., do those who almost complete a course have higher returns than those who progressed less. Matching US community college transcripts between 2002 and 2004 with earnings data in 2011 they find that among non-completers, students who progressed further in their course earned less. Specifically, students who progressed twice as far as the average non-completer earned 4-5\% less. The penalty for progression was similar for females and males.\cite{jacobson2005} found a similar pattern among male displaced workers: those who completed 12-18 months of community college earned more than those who studied beyond this. However, they estimated the opposite effect for female displaced workers. \cite{zeidenberg2015} posit that after taking the relatively valuable foundation courses, students may lack the motivation, time, or funds for the upper-level courses, which are no more valuable in the labor market but are required for graduation. Grouping all students together, \cite{zeidenberg2015} find that non-completers earn 32\% less than those who graduate with a diploma and 37\% less than those who complete an associate degree, revealing large returns for those who obtain a qualification. Certificates holders and non-completers were found to earn about the same, possibly because they acquire a similar number of credits. \cite{xu2016} analysis illustrates that many adult learners use short-term certificates to switch to a new industry and may explain why certificate holders do not experience an immediate boost in earnings. By subject, earnings differences were not substantial except for nursing, where earnings gains were disproportionately large at 104\%. In general, earnings appear to differ more by qualification than by subject \citep{zeidenberg2015}.
%
%These findings are consolidated in \cite{belfield2017} extensive review of community college returns in the US between 1996 and 2013, spanning 8 states. The studies follow the individual fixed effects approach established in Jacobson et al. (2005). The estimated average earnings were 26\% (18\%) higher than non-completers for females (males) with an associate degree, amounting to approximately \$7,000\footnote{US dollars in 2014.} (\$5,000) per year, with the gains persisting overtime. Returns to certificate holders were more mixed but in general show positive, albeit modest, returns relative to non-completers. Again, females outperformed males in their returns and on average earned around \$3,000 per year more than non-completers while males earn around \$2,000 per year more than non-completers. In general, certificates that required more credits had higher earnings gains. Credits were also associated with earnings gains, even for those who didn’t complete an award. The accumulation of credits with no award, however, does not appear to be as valuable as the award itself, although in some states the difference in returns between an award and an equivalent number of credits was negligible.
%
%Given that students need time to realise the full benefits of training, accounting for this substantially increases estimates of long-term earnings gains. \cite{jacobson2005} showed that displaced workers were worse off immediately after leaving college relative to what they would have been without returning to school, but that earnings tended to rise quickly in the following year, before leveling out to a new, higher level. This highlights the need for long follow-up periods in the data when assessing the returns to education.

\section{Context: Higher education and Vocational Study in Australia}

Mature-age education in Australia is among the highest in the world. In 2014, Australia's participation in vocational education by those aged 25-64 was the highest among OECD countries. The tertiary education rate for those aged 30-64 was the second highest \citep{perales2017}. Mature-age Australians are increasingly enrolling in university or college to change employers, change careers, gain extra skills, improve their promotion prospects and earning capability or search for better work/life balance. Redundancy and unemployment have also been driving forces for individuals to return to education later in life \citep{coelli2012}.

The increase in mature-age learners accessing higher education has in part been driven by government policy. In 2009, the Australian government adopted a national target of at least 40\% of 25-34-year-olds having attained a qualification at bachelor level or above by 2025 \citep{oshea2015}. This was part of a policy that transitioned Australia to a demand-driven system \citep{ua2020}. The policy had a large effect on access to higher education, as it removed the cap on the number of university student places. By 2017, 39\% of 25-34-year-olds had a bachelor’s degree or higher \citep{caruso2018}. The demand-driven system effectively came to an end in 2018 when the government capped funding at 2017 levels. While the initial uptake of higher education in the demand-driven system was strong, especially among mature-age students \citep{ua2019}, the cap coincided with a decline in enrolments for both undergraduate and vocational courses \citep{ua2020, atkinson2016, ncver2021}. 

%The transition to a demand-driven system in Australia in 2009 \citep{ua2020} also had a large effect on access to higher education, as it removed the cap on the number of university student places. As a result, the number of Commonwealth Supported Places (CSPs) increased by 150\% between 2008 and 2017\footnote{From approximately 4,000 places to 12,000 places.} \citep{ua2020} as more students could access university at a subsidised rate. The introduction of the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program (HEPPP) in 2010 helped to improve access for disadvantaged students as higher education providers were granted funding according to their share of domestic undergraduate students from low SES backgrounds \citepalias{department2021}. In 2021, the definition of disadvantage was expanded to include the share of students from regional and remote areas and Indigenous backgrounds. The Higher Education Loan Program (HELP), introduced in 1989 as ‘HECS’ and originally designed to support CSP (undergraduate) students by offering income-contingent loans, was expanded in 2005 to support full-fee paying domestic students, and again in 2007 to support students undertaking higher education VET courses \citep{parliament2017}. This broadened access to loans to students undertaking courses other than a university bachelor’s degree. Since most CSPs are awarded for undergraduate degrees, the majority of CSP students are under 25 years old (78\% in 2018) \citep{ua2020}. Students pursuing post-graduate or vocational courses generally do not qualify for a CSP place. Instead, they can defer their tuition fees through HELP loans, allowing the mature-age cohort to access higher education while juggling other financial commitments.
%
%While the initial uptake of university places in the demand-driven system was strong, especially among mature-age students\footnote{Between 2010 and 2012, growth in mature-age enrolments in undergraduate courses doubled for the 30-39 age group and tripled for the 40+ age group.} \citep{ua2019}, growth in undergraduate enrolments started to slow in 2012. By 2018, mature-age enrolments actually declined, dropping below the previous year's level. The 40+ age group showed the slowest growth, receding by 10\%, while the 25-29’s and 30-39’s receded by around 4\% \citep{ua2020}. The decline in enrolments coincided with a cap on government funding in 2017, effectively ending the demand-driven system \citep{ua2020}. Similar trends are observed for mature-age students participating in vocational education and training (VET). VET participation increased between 2010 and 2012 with the introduction of the demand-driven system but then continued its decline \citep{atkinson2016} until stabilising between 2018 and 2020 \citep{ncver2021}. 
%The impact of COVID-19 on 2021 enrolments is yet to be fully determined. So far, VET enrolments for the first half of 2021 are well above the previous 4 years across all age groups, with $\sim$1 million enrolments in 2021 compared to $\sim$870 thousand enrolments in 2017\footnote{Government funded program enrolments Jan-June 2017-2021.} \citep{ncver2021}.

%
%The demand-driven system almost doubled the number of undergraduate enrolments from underrepresented groups between 2008 and 2018, including students from low socio-economic backgrounds, regional and remote areas, Indigenous backgrounds, and students with a disability \citep{ua2020}. Despite the large increase in enrolments, attrition and completion rates have not changed dramatically over the same period and show mixed results. Low SES students show lower rates of attrition at TAFE\footnote{Table C and NUHEI (non-university higher education institutions) providers, includes private universities, colleges, and TAFEs.} in both postgraduate (-14pp) and bachelor courses (-5pp) \citepalias{department2019a}. While low SES students also improved their attrition at university\footnote{Table A and B providers, includes public universities and self-accredited private universities.} at post-graduate level (-1pp), this group had higher attrition at the bachelor level (2pp). Completion rates followed a similar trend (in the opposite direction) \citepalias{department2019b}. The pattern is very similar for remote and regional students, with attrition rates falling in all categories except for a slight increase for regional bachelor students. Post-graduate Indigenous students show large drops in attrition at both the university and TAFE level, by between 7 and 11pp, while bachelor students at both institution types show a slight increase in attrition (0-1pp). Mature-age cohorts, across all students and not just disadvantaged groups, reveal the same trend, with attrition and completion rates improving across all categories except university bachelor’s degrees. However, compared with 20-24-year-olds, mature-age students have lower completion rates in general, regardless of level or institution, but this has not changed overtime. Similar to the 20-24 age group, mature-age students have twice as much success completing postgraduate degrees than bachelor’s degrees ($\sim$ 30\% vs 60\%). The same is true for advantaged groups\footnote{Medium \& High SES, Metropolitan, and Non-indigenous students.} , with bachelor students at university also showing slightly higher attrition ($\sim$2pp) over the same period. Since all groups of students are less likely to complete university-level bachelor courses, it appears that broadening the student cohort to disadvantaged groups has not reduced the success rates in higher education, and in fact, disadvantaged groups have improved their rates of completion and attrition in the last 10 years since 2008 in all other courses.
%
%The Australian government introduced an additional scheme in 2019 to support workers aged 45-70 looking to reskill or upskill in order to remain employed \citepalias{department2022a}. Workers must be at risk of entering the income support system or recently unemployed to be eligible for support. The Skills and Training Incentive program subsidises accredited and non-accredited courses as long as the training is linked to their current job, a future job opportunity or an industry/skill in national shortage. Eligible courses are identified when individuals complete a Skills Checkpoint assessment and can be subsidised up to \$2200, regardless of the number of courses taken. Within this limit, up to 75\% of course fees can be subsidised when they relate to skills in national shortage, while all others can receive up to 50\% of course fees. The number of incentives available per year are capped at increasing levels up to 2024 (between 1,800 and 7,500) when the scheme is set to end \citepalias{department2022b}.
%

The cost of a bachelor’s degree for domestic students in Australia is the sixth highest among OECD countries \citep{ua2020}. In 2018, the average annual cost of a bachelor’s degree was around \$5,000. VET and TAFE/college courses in Australia cost a minimum of \$4,000 per year on average while post-graduate courses cost a minimum of \$20,000 per year on average \citep{studies2018}. Mature-age students can cover the cost of further study themselves or they can receive support from the government. Many undergraduate students can access the Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) scheme which subsidises tuition fees for those studying at public universities and some private higher education providers. Postgraduate students are generally not covered by the CSP. Students at university, approved higher education providers or in VET can access financial support from the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) scheme, which provides income-contingent loans. This allows students to defer their tuition fees until their earnings reach the compulsory repayment threshold, upon which repayments are deducted from their pay throughout the year at a set rate. CSPs and HELP loans, however, are withdrawn from students who fail half of their subjects.

%
%To cover the cost of higher education, Australian domestic students have two main ways to receive support from the government. The Commonwealth Supported Place (CSP) scheme, mainly offered to undergraduate students, subsidises tuition fees for those studying at public universities and some private higher education providers. Students who meet the eligibility criteria (domestic students at an approved education provider) are automatically assigned a CSP. Most CSPs are for undergraduate study but some providers offer CSPs at the postgraduate level. From 2022, CSP places are capped at 7 years of full-time study. Once this allotment has been used, an additional 3 years of full-time subsidised study will be available 10 years from start date of the last course \citep{sa2022a}.
%
%The second, and broader, source of financial support is the Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) which provides income-contingent loans to students at university or higher education providers. This allows students to defer their tuition fees until their earnings reach the compulsory repayment threshold, upon which repayments are deducted from their pay throughout the year at a set rate. Voluntary repayments can also be made. In 2022, HELP loans were limited to around \$110,000 and the repayment threshold was around \$47,000 \footnote{Values are in Australian dollars.} \citep{sa2022b}. To qualify for HELP, students must be studying at approved HELP providers. Once accepted into their course, students can apply for HELP via their institution by submitting their tax file number and a HELP form.
%
%HECS-HELP is the HELP scheme available to CSP students while FEE-HELP is the HELP scheme available to full-fee paying students who don’t qualify for a CSP i.e., post-graduate students. VET Students Loans (formerly VET FEE-HELP) are also part of the HELP scheme and are available to students undertaking vocational education and training (VET) courses outside of higher education \citep{ua2020}. CSPs and HELP loans are withdrawn from students who fail half of their subjects, assessed on a yearly or half-yearly basis depending on the level of study\footnote{Yearly at bachelor level and per trimester for courses lower than bachelor level.}.

\section{Data}

We use data from the Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia (HILDA)
survey. These data are rich, and we exploit the full set of background
information on individuals (beginning with more than 3,400 variables per
observation). HILDA covers a long time span of 19 years, starting in 2001. We use the 2019 release. This means we observe respondents annually from 2001 to 2019.

\subsection{Sample exclusions}

Our main analysis sample contains respondents who were 25 years or above in 2001. This allows us to focus on individuals who obtain a further education beyond that acquired in their previous degree. Our main analysis focuses on measuring the impact of further education using
wave 19 outcomes. Here, the feature inputs to the models are taken from the
individuals in 2001. We drop any individuals who were ‘currently studying’ in 2001. This also ensures that our features, which are defined in 2001 are not
contaminated by the impacts of studying but clearly precede the study spell of
interest. These sample exclusions result in 7,359 respondents being dropped
because they are below the age of 25 in 2001 and a further 1,387 respondents
being dropped because they were studying in 2001.
We then restrict the sample to those who are present in both 2001 and 2019. This ensures that we observe base characteristics and outcomes for every person in our analysis sample. This results in a further 5,727 respondents being dropped from the sample. Our analysis sample has 5,441 observations. More details of our main analysis sample and data can be found in Online Appendix \ref{app:main}.%\footnote{For sensitivity analysis, a second sample of respondents are examined. They are slightly younger when they began study, their feature values are taken in the two years before study began and their outcomes are measured four years after their study began. In this second sample, there are 1,814 individuals who started and completed a further educational degree, and 60,945 person-wave control observations who never completed a further degree. We detail our second approach in Online Appendix \ref{app:sensitivity}.}

%We then extend our main analysis in a number of ways. First, we include dynamic control variables. Specifically, we define the features in the one and two years immediately before study start. With two years of data, we are able to construct variables that measure the trends in socio-economic and demographic characteristics. Second, we measure outcomes fours years after the start of a spell of study. 

%For sensitivity analysis, we also examine a second sample of respondents who are: (1) at least 22 years old in the starting year of study, (2) they were present in the two years before the start of study and (3) there were not currently studying in any of the two years before the starting year of further study. If a study event does not satisfy these conditions, we look to the next study event that satisfies these conditions or (if unavailable) delete the person from our sample completely. There are 3,271 individuals who started and completed a further educational degree. 
%
%For control group observations they have not completed further study, which makes it difficult to define their features and outcomes around a study-start date. Thus, we assign to them a time stamp for a theoretical start date to study. We do this for every year from 2003 to 2019.  This implies that control group individuals can be duplicated and used multiple times. Such duplication induces a dependence structure that artificially reduces standard errors. Thus, we account for clustering and heteroskedasticity of any type at the individual level. There are 13,311 unique control observations. We detail our approach in the Online Appendix Document 2. 



\subsection{Outcomes}

We code the values of the outcome variables based on the survey panel data from Wave 17 onwards. This is to allow us to measure the long-term impact of formal re-training. It also ensures the outcome is measured `after' the individual has started their formal retraining. This minimises the chance that our analysis results are subject to reverse causation issues.

For the outcome of entrepreneurship, we include individuals who `became' self-employed from Wave 17 onwards. This means they were observed to not be self-employed in the previous wave and then subsequently transitioned into self-employment. For the outcome of earnings, we only use the 2019 wave to measure this outcome. This means that we measure earnings at least 2 years after an individual completes their formal re-training. We use annual earnings to measure the economic returns to education. Last, we also analyse outcomes related to the labour market such as employment, changes in earnings, changes in occupation, industry, and jobs. These are also measured after 2018. %\footnote{A second approach is to use outcomes measured four years after the start of a study spell. For sensitivity analysis, we repeat our main estimations using this second approach. Here, as many individuals in our dataset never started a further degree i.e. they are in our control group, we assign a time stamp to them for every year the control person theoretically could have started to study. We do this for every year from 2003 to 2019. This implies that control group individuals can be duplicated multiple times in the dataset. We then measure the control individuals' outcomes 4 years after their theoretical time stamp.}


\subsection{Treatment}

We define further education as an individual who obtains a further degree in a formal, structured re-training or educational program. For short, we refer to this as `re-training' throughout the paper since it characterises the second (or subsequent) degree individuals obtain after their first degree. These programs must be delivered by a certified training, teaching or research institution. Thus, we do not analyse informal on-line degrees (such as Coursera degrees). We also do not consider on-the-job training as obtaining further education.

Our treatment variable is a binary variable that takes the value of 1 if an individual has obtained an additional degree anytime between wave 2 (2002) and wave 17 (2017). We drop any respondent who obtained a qualification after wave 17. 

HILDA documents formal degree attainment in two ways. The first is to ask respondents, in every wave, what is their highest level of education. The second way is to ask respondents, in every wave, if they have acquired an additional educational degree since the last time they were interviewed. We utilise both these questions to construct our measure of further education. Using the first question, we compare if the highest level of education in 2017 differs from that in 2001. If there has been an upgrade in educational qualification between these two years, we set the treatment indicator to be one and zero otherwise. This question, however, only captures upgrades in education; it fails to capture additional qualifications that are at the same level or below as the degree acquired previously by the respondent. We rely on the second survey question to fill this gap.

These two survey questions thus capture any additional qualification obtained from 2002 to 2017, inclusive. Additional qualifications refer to the following types of degrees: Trade certificates or apprenticeships, Teaching or nursing qualifications, Certificate I to IV, Associate degrees, Diplomas (2-year and 3-year fulltime), Graduate certificates, Bachelor, Honours, Masters and Doctorate degrees.

\subsection{Covariates/features}

We define our covariates, or features as they are known in machine learning
parlance, using 2001 as the base year. Since we drop any respondents who were
currently studying in 2001, we ensure that all features were defined before a
respondent begins further study.%\footnote{We also test the sensitivity of our results to using feature inputs that are taken from the individuals closer to the timing of their study, namely two years before study began. Here, we use both the year and the two years preceding the start of a study spell to define our features. This allows us to capture both level and growth values in the features.}

A unique approach to our feature selection strategy is that we use all the
information available to us from the HILDA survey in 2001. This means that we
have more than 3,400 raw variables per observation. Before using the features
in a ML model, we delete any features that are identifiers or otherwise deemed
irrelevant for explaining the outcome.

In order to reduce redundancy in this vast amount of information, we next apply a supervised Machine learning model to predict outcomes 5 years ahead of 2001 i.e. in 2006. We then select the top 100 variables that are most predictive of the outcome in 2006.\footnote{Confounders are features that both have an impact on the outcome and on the treatment. \cite{cherno2018} suggest including the union of features kept in the two structural equations (outcome on features and treatment on features). Here, we only include the features that predict the outcome equation because including features that are only predictive of the treatment can erroneously pick up instrumental variables (see \cite{pearl2012class} for a discussion of this issue). } These variables are listed in Table \ref{tab:sumstats}. 


\section{Descriptive Figures and Tables}

We calculate the average returns to degree completion for mature-age students who completed degrees between 2002 and 2017. The window in which study and degree-completion took place is noticeably large. However, sample size limitations with our survey data mean that it is not feasible to run an ML analysis, disaggregated by the timing-of-completion.

In order to obtain some insights into the potential heterogeneity over time, we present a series of descriptive graphs in this section. Here, our aim is not to present any causal analysis but to describe which groups studied earlier in the time period (and thus had more time to accumulate returns). These graphs can also point to the potential different factors driving study across the time period, and different effects on earnings depending on how much time has elapsed since completion. 

Figure \ref{fig:yearcomp} presents the distribution of degree completion over time. There is a steep decline in degree-completion proportions over time. This is likely to reflect the aging profile of HILDA survey respondents and that further study is disproportionately higher among the younger cohorts (25-44 year olds) (see Figure \ref{fig:degbyage}).

Over time, Figure \ref{fig:yearcompdeg} shows that the composition of degrees completed has shifted. Among those who completed a degree in later years, compared to those who completed a degree in the earlier period, a higher percentage completed a Certificate III or IV, Diploma or Advanced Diploma as opposed to a lower-level degree (Certificate I or II or below). In all years, the most frequently completed degrees are Cert 3 or 4, Associate degrees, Diplomas and Advanced Diplomas. 

%removed graph below, samples are too small.
%Figure \ref{fig:yearcompgen} shows that the gender composition for degree completions between 2002 and 2017, inclusive. Females tend to be more likely to complete degrees than males and this gender disparity has slightly increased over time. However, there is a stark difference in the types of degrees completed across gender. 

%Figure \ref{fig:yearcompdeggen} shows the distribution across degree type over time, and further broken down by gender. Males are more likely to complete a Certificate III or IV, Diploma or Advanced Diploma, than females. By contrast, females are more likely to complete a Certificate I or II or a degree below this level. Females, however, as also more likely to complete a degree at the level of Bachelor or higher, than males. 

%This trend that has increased across time with a sharp discontinuity occurring in 2012. 
The predominance of Cert 3 or 4 degrees is common across gender. Although, Figure \ref{fig:degbysex} shows the distribution of degrees is more heavily skewed towards these degrees for men then they are for women. 

Figure \ref{fig:yearearnent} shows an increase in average earnings of around \$380 between 2002 and 2017. The proportion entering entrepreneurship decreased slightly by 2 percentage points over the period but has been volatile since 2009. For example, in 2016 entrepreneurship reached a high of 20\% before falling to 5\% in 2017. Earnings also show high volatility from 2008. This likely reflects the smaller sample sizes in the later years of the survey. In our main analysis we average the returns over time as the samples within each year are inadequate to draw inference about heterogeneity across time. 

%Figure \ref{fig:sexearnempl} breaks these outcomes down by gender. Among females, the proportion employed increased up to 2012 to rise above the proportion of males employed. Following 2012, female employment trended down while male employment trended up. While female average earnings were below male average earnings through most of the period, the catch up to male earnings subsided in 2012 also. 



\section{Method}

We aim to estimate the causal impact of obtaining a new qualification. Our empirical challenge is a missing data one in the sense that we do not observe the counterfactual outcome for each person -- what would have their income been if they had/had not obtained a new qualification?

We use capitalisation to denote random variables, where $Y \in \mathbb{R}^+$ is
the outcome variable for income and $Y \in \{0, 1\}$ for entrepreneurship, $T
\in \{0, 1\}$ is the binary treatment indicator, and $X \in \mathcal{X}$ are
the conditioning variables (which can be a mix of continuous or categorical in
type). Small case is used to denote realisations of these random variables,
e.g. $y$, $t$ and $x$, and we may use a subscript for an individual
realisation, e.g. $y_i$ for individual $i$ from a sample of size $n$.

Under the potential outcomes framework of \cite{imbens2015}, $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ denote the outcomes we would have observed if treatment were set to zero ($T=0$) or one ($T=1$), respectively. In reality, we only observe the potential outcome that corresponds to the realised treatment,
\begin{align}
Y = T \cdot Y(1) + (1-T) \cdot Y(0).
\end{align}

The missing data problem (or the lack of counterfactuals) is especially problematic when the treated group is different from the control group in ways that also affect outcomes. Such selection issues mean that we cannot simply take the difference in the average of the non-missing values of $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$.

To address the missing data problem, we turn to a range of ML-based techniques.
Standard ML tools are purposed to predict, but our aim is to estimate the
causal parameter. These are different aims, and so we have to adapt the ML
tools. We may potentially bias our causal parameter of interest if we were to
use the off-the-shelf tools. For example, if we were to select the important
confounders using an ML model to predict the outcome $Y$, then we may
undervalue the importance of variables that are highly correlated to the
treatment $T$ but only weakly predictive of $Y$ \citep{cherno2018}.

We approach filling the missing data indirectly with three types of ML models
that have been specially adapted to causal inference. They are: the T-Learner,
Doubly Robust and Bayesian models. 

\subsubsection*{Identification assumptions}

To interpret the estimated parameter as a causal relationship, we require the following identification assumptions:
Conditional independence ($Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ are independent of $T$ conditional on $X$); SUTVA: Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption ($Y = Y(0) + T \cdot (Y(1) - Y(0))$); Overlap Assumption (no subpopulation defined by $X = x$ is entirely located in the treatment or control group); Exogeneity of features (the features included in the conditioning set are not affected by the treatment). With the strong ignorability and overlap assumptions in place, treatment effect estimation reduces to estimating two response surfaces, one for treatment and one for control.

%\begin{enumerate}
%  \item \textbf{Conditional independence} (or conditional ignorability/ exogeneity/ unconfoundedness) Rubin (1980): $Y(0)$ and $Y(1)$ are independent of $T$ conditional on $X$; i.e. $\left\{Y(0), Y(1)\right\} \perp T~|~X$.  
%\end{enumerate}

%This assumption requires that the treatment assignment is independent of the two potential outcomes. Practically, this amounts to assuming that components of the observable characteristics available in our data, or flexible combinations of them, can proxy for unobservable characteristics. Otherwise, unobservable confounding bias remains.

%A benefit of using all the features the HILDA dataset has to offer is that we may minimise unobserved confounding effects. Specifically, we rely on the 3,400 features and complex interactions between them as well as flexible functional forms to proxy for components of this unobserved heterogeneity. For example, while we do not observe ability or aptitude directly, we may capture components of it with other measures that are observed in HILDA such as past educational attainment or the long list of income and other sources of income variables (see Table 1 for a list of the features). 

%The reader is likely to conceptualise other dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity that may not be captured in Table 1. There are two likely scenarios in this case. First, HILDA may not be exhaustive enough, even with its existing richness, to capture all dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity. As a result, our estimates may be biased. 

%Another potential scenario is that the source of unobserved heterogeneity in question (or some components of it) is still captured but modelled under the guise of another variable label. Variables that are highly correlated with each other are unlikely to be simultaneously included in the model. This is because the ML algorithm, in attempting to reduce the amount of information redundancy, may have randomly dropped one or more of those correlated variables. 

%\begin{enumerate}
%  \setcounter{enumi}{1}
%
%  \item \textbf{Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption} (SUTVA) or
%    counterfactual consistency: $Y = Y(0) + T \cdot (Y(1) - Y(0))$. 
%
%\end{enumerate}  

%Assumption 2 ensures that there is no interference, no spill-over effects, and no hidden variation between treated and non-treated observations. SUTVA may be violated if individuals who complete further education influence the labour market outcomes of those who do not complete further education. For example, if the former group absorb resources that would otherwise be channelled to the latter group. Alternatively, the former group may be more competitive in the labour market and reduce the probability of promotions or job-finding for the latter group. As those who complete further education are a relatively small group, it is unlikely that these general equilibrium effects would occur. 

%\begin{enumerate}
%  \setcounter{enumi}{2}
%  \item \textbf{Overlap Assumption} (or common support or positivity): no
%    subpopulation defined by $X = x$ is entirely located in the treatment or
%    control group, hence the treatment probability needs to be bounded away
%    from zero and one.
%\end{enumerate}

%The overlap is an important assumption because counterfactual extrapolation
%using the predictive models, 
%\begin{align}
%  \mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x, T{=}1] &\approx \mu_1(x) \quad \textrm{and} \label{eq:T1} \\
%  \mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x, T{=}0] &\approx \mu_0(x) \label{eq:T0}
%\end{align}
%is likely to perform best for treatment and control subpopulations that have a
%large degree of overlap in $\mathcal{X}$. If the treatment and control groups
%had no common support in $\mathcal{X}$, we would be pushing our counterfactual
%estimators to predict into regions with no support in the training data, and
%therefore we would have no means by which to evaluate their performance.
%
%This means the optimum bias-variance trade-off point for the conditional
%average treatment effect may not align with the optimum bias-variance trade-off
%point for the separate $\mu_1(x)$ and $\mu_0(x)$ models. Since, ultimately we
%are interested in the CATEs (as opposed to the predictive accuracy of the
%individual conditional mean functions), this can mean that we have biased
%CATEs.

%\begin{enumerate}
%  \setcounter{enumi}{3}
%  \item \textbf{Exogeneity of covariates/features:} the features included in the conditioning set are not affected by the treatment. 
%\end{enumerate}

%To ensure this, we define all of our features at a time point before any
%individual started studying. Specifically, we use the first wave of HILDA (in
%2001) to define our features. We only look at those individuals who completed
%further education in 2002 onwards. Furthermore, we delete any individuals who
%were currently studying in 2001 to ensure the features cannot reflect
%downstream effects of current study. 

\subsection{T-Learner model}

The first adaptation of ML models for causal estimation is the T-learner approach. We aim to measure the amount by which the
response $Y$ would differ between hypothetical worlds in which the treatment
was set to $T=1$ versus $T=0$, and to estimate this across subpopulations
defined by attributes $X$. 

The T-learner is a two-step approach where the conditional mean functions defined in Equations (\ref{eq:T1}) and (\ref{eq:T0}) are estimated separately with any generic machine learning algorithm.
\begin{align}
  \mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x, T{=}1] &\approx \mu_1(x) \quad \textrm{and} \label{eq:T1} \\
  \mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x, T{=}0] &\approx \mu_0(x) \label{eq:T0}
\end{align}

Machine learning methods are well suited to find generalizable predictive patterns, and we employ a range of model classes including linear (LASSO and Ridge) and non-linear (Gradient Boosted Regression~\citep{friedman2001}). Once we obtain the two conditional mean functions, for each observation, we can predict the outcome under treatment and control by plugging each observation into both functions. Taking the difference between the two outcomes results in the Conditional Average Treatment Effect (CATE), and averaging yeilds the Average Treatment Effect (ATE),
\begin{align}
  \hat{ATE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum^n_{i=1} \mu_1(x_i) - \mu_0(x_i).
\end{align}
%
%To show this, we define our parameter of interest, the CATE, which is formally defined as:
%\begin{align}
%\tau (x) = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) | X{=}x],
%\end{align}
%which, with the assumptions outlined previously, is equivalent to taking the
%difference between two conditional mean functions $\mu _1(x) - \mu _0(x)$:
%\begin{align}
%\tau (x) & = \mu _1(x) - \mu _0(x) \nonumber \\
%  & \approx \mathbb{E}[Y | T {=} 1, X {=} x] - \mathbb{E}[Y | T {=} 0, X {=} x] \nonumber \\
%& = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0) | X {=} x]. \label{eq:indTE}
%\end{align}
%In this estimation, we are not interested in the coefficients from regressing
%$Y$ on $X$. What we require is a good approximation of the function $\tau(x)$,
%and hence good estimates from $\mu_1(x)$ and $\mu_0(x)$, which is within the
%perview of machine learning methods.
%
%A benefit of our set-up is that when we take the difference between the two conditional mean functions, we coincidently find the optimum bias-variance trade-off point for the conditional average treatment effect. This means that we have an indirect way to obtain the best prediction of the CATE through two predictive equations, where we observe the true outcomes (and thus are able to regularise).
%
In practice, however, this indirect way of minimising the mean squared error
for each separate function to proxy for the minimum mean squared error of the
treatment effect can be problematic. See, for example,
\cite{kunzel2019,kennedy2020} for settings when the T-learner is not the
optimal choice. One potential estimation problem arises when there are fewer
treated individuals than control individuals and the individual regression
functions are non-smooth. In this instance the response surfaces can be
difficult to estimate in isolation, and the T-learner does not exploit the
shared information between treatment and control observations. For example, if
$X$ relates to $Y$ in the same fashion for treated and control observations the
T-learner cannot utilise this information. As a result, the estimate $\mu_1$
tends to over smooth the function; in contrast, the estimate $\mu_0$
regularises to a lesser degree because there are more control observations.
This means a na\"ive plug-in estimator of the CATE that simply takes the
difference between $\mu_1 - \mu_0$ will be a poor and overly complex estimator
of the true difference. It will tend to overstate the presence of heterogeneous
treatment effects. We turn to other ML models to address this potential
problem.

\subsection{Doubly Robust model}

The second approach is the Doubly Robust learner (DR-learner). It is similar to
the T-learner in that it separately models the treatment and control surfaces,
but it uses additional information from a propensity score model. In this case
the propensity score model is a machine learning classifier that attempts
to estimate the treatment assignment process,
\begin{align}
  \mathbb{E}[T{=}1|X{=}x] &= \mathbb{P}(T{=}1|X{=}x) \approx \rho(x),
\end{align}
where $\rho(x)$ as a probabilistic machine learning classifier. This allows
information about the students' background, and the nature and complexity of
their situation that may have led them to pursue further education to be
incorporated into the model. Thus, the doubly robust approach can improve upon
the T-learner approach because it can reduce misspecification error either
through a correctly specified propensity score model or through correctly
specified outcome equations. Another feature of the Doubly Robust approach is
that it places a higher weight on observations in the area where the relative
count of treatment and control observations is more balanced (i.e. the area of
overlap). This may allow better extrapolations of the predicted outcomes within
the region of overlap. The ATE is estimated from three separate estimators, 
\begin{equation}
  \hat{ATE} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}
    \left[\frac{t_i(y_i - \mu_1(x_i))} {\rho(x_i)} + \mu_1(x_i) \right]
    - \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} 
    \left[ \frac{(1-t_i)(y_i - \mu_0(x_i))}{1-\rho(x_i)} + \mu_0(x_i) \right] \label{eq:DR}
\end{equation}
% where:
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item ${\rho}(x_i)$ is an estimation of $\mathbb{E}[T{=}1|X{=}x_i]$ -- the propensity score, using logistic regression,
%   \item $\mu_1(x_i)$ is an estimation of $\mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x_i, T{=}1]$ using any regression model,
%   \item $\mu_0(x_i)$ is an estimation of $\mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x_i,T{=}0]$ using any regression model.
% \end{itemize}
Previously, with the T-learner, we were just estimating $\mu_0(x)$ and
$\mu_1(x)$. With the DR-learner, we augment $\mu_0(x)$ and $\mu_1(x)$. For
example, for the treated observations, we augment $\mu_1(x)$ by multiplying the
prediction error by the inverse propensity scores. This up-weights those who
get treated but who are statistically similar to the control observations. We
then apply this same augmentation to the $\mu_0(x)$ for the control
observations. 


\subsection{Bayesian Models}

The third approach is to use Bayesian models. We follow the general formulation
presented by \cite{hahn2020} that suggests a predictive model of the following
form,
\begin{align}
  \mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x_i, T{=}t_i] \approx \mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) 
    + \tau(x_i)\cdot t_i, \label{eq:bayesmods}
\end{align}
where $\mathbb{E}[T=1|X{=}x_i] \approx \rho(x_i)$ is the propensity score of
individual $i$ for the treatment. The component $\mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i))$ is
known as the `prognostic' effect, and is the impact of the control variates,
$X$, on the outcome without the treatment. Then we are left with $\tau(x_i)$,
which is the individual treatment effect,
\begin{align*}
  \mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x_i, T{=}1] - \mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x_i, T{=}0] &\approx 
    \left[\mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) + \tau(x_i)\right] - \mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)), \\
    &=\tau(x_i).
\end{align*}
Average treatment effect is then just simply estimated as,
\begin{align*}
  \hat{ATE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1} \tau(x_i).
\end{align*}
This approach allows us to place explicit and separate priors on the prognostic and treatment
components of the models. This minimises bias in the form of
regularisation induced confounding (RIC) which is discussed in more detail in
\cite{hahn2018, hahn2020}. It is also a very natural way to estimate
heterogeneous treatment effects, since we can parameterise $\tau(x_i)$
directly as an additive effect on $\mu_0$, rather than having to separately 
parameterise control and treatment surfaces.

However, since the entrepreneurial outcome is binary we had to modify Equation
(\ref{eq:bayesmods}) to have a sigmoid curve to keep the model likelihood in
the range $[0, 1]$. This also ensures the model's posterior distribution over
parameters reflects the true range of the outcome. So our Bayesian model
becomes, \begin{align} \mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x_i, T{=}t_i] \approx \sigma\!\left(
\mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) + \tau(x_i)\cdot t_i\right), \label{eq:bayesmods_clf}
\end{align} where $\sigma(\cdot)$ is a logistic sigmoid. Unfortunately this
nonlinear sigmoid breakes the seperability of the prognostic and treatment
models when computing the ATE, which we no compute as, 
\begin{align*} \hat{ATE} =
  \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1} \sigma\!\left( \mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) + \tau(x_i)
  \right) - \sigma\!\left( \mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) \right).
\end{align*}
%
  %The advantage of this approach are manifold. From a Bayesian perspective, it
  %allows us to place explicit and separate priors on the prognostic and
  %treatment components of the models. For example, it may be sensible to
  %expect the prognostic component to be flexible and strongly predictive of
  %the outcome, while me may expect that the treatment component is relatively
  %simple and small
  %in magnitude \citep{hahn2020}. Furthermore, this separation of model
  %components and inclusion of the propensity score minimises bias in the form
  %of regularisation induced confounding (RIC) which is discussed in more
  %detain in \citep{hahn2018, hahn2020}. And finally, it is a very natural way
  %to estimate heterogeneous treatment effects, since we can parameterise
  %$\tau(x_i)$
  %directly as an additive effect on $\mu_0$, rather than having to separately
  %parameterise control and treatment surfaces.
%
We explore three different model classes for $\mu_0$ and $\tau$. The first is a
linear model for both prognostic and treatment models. The next uses a Gaussian
process (GP) for the earnings outcome, and an approximate GP for the
entrepreneurship outcome. Lastly we use Bayesian additive regression trees
(BART) for the earnings outcome (only). We detail these models in the following
sections. 

% The third approach is to use three different Bayesian S-learners. S-learners
% are simply regression models that take the treatment factor as an additional
% input covariate, $\mathbb{E}[Y| X{=}x, T{=}t] = \mu(x, t)$, and then estimate the ATE as,
% \begin{align*}
%   \hat{ATE} = \frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i=1} \mu(x_i, 1) - \mu(x_i, 0).
% \end{align*}

% The first two models are empirical Bayesian models, that is, they use
% optimisation algorithms to both find closed-form posterior distributions over
% their parameters, while also tuning their prior distribution parameters, as
% opposed to placing hyper-priors on these parameters\footnote{The assumptions
% underlying this approach are discussed in Chapter 3.5 of \cite{bishop2006}.}.
% The third is a fully hierarchical Bayesian linear model, that uses Markov-chain
% Monte-Carlo (MCMC) sampling for posterior inference.

% \todo{These will all probably suffer from bias as all covariates are subject
% to regularisation, and may suppress the contribution of T, and those variables
% that are important for predicting T.}

% \subsubsection*{Bayesian Ridge Regression}

% The first Bayesian model is a Bayesian ridge regressor \citep{tipping2001}. We
% simply include the treatment factor, $T$, as another covariate in the model.
% Then the ATE is the marginal posterior distribution (which is Normal) of the
% regression coefficient corresponding to $T$. This is a similar approach to an
% OLS cross-sectional model with controls, but it makes use of regularisation so
% more controls can be included without worrying overly about collinearity.
% Furthermore, the empirical Bayesian nature of this model allows for automatic
% selection of the regularisation strength of the model coefficients. This model
% can only estimate an average treatment effect, as the effect is modelled as a
% single dummy variable.

\subsubsection*{Hierarchical Linear/Logistic Models}

The first Bayesian model uses linear prognostic and treatment components,
\begin{align*}
  \mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) &= w_0 + w_x^\top x_i + w_\rho \rho(x_i), \\
  \tau(x_i) &= w_t + w_{tx}^\top x_i.
\end{align*}
The propensity score, $\rho(x_i)$, is obtained from a logistic regression
model. We also tested a gradient boosted classifier \citep{friedman2001} for
this using five-fold nested cross validation. It did not seem to be
significantly more performant than the logistic model on held-out log-loss
score.
 
%from Equation~(\ref{eq:bayesmods}),
%\begin{align*}
%y_i &\sim \mathcal{N}\!\left(
%  \mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) + \tau(x_i)\cdot t_i, 
%  \sigma^2\right) 
%  \quad\textrm{where}, \\
%\mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) &= w_0 + w_x^\top x_i + w_\rho \rho(x_i), \\
%\tau(x_i) &= w_t + w_{tx}^\top x_i.
%\end{align*}
%We have used the following hierarchical priors,
%\begin{align*}
%  \{\lambda_0, \lambda_x, \lambda_\rho\} &\sim \textrm{Uniform}(0, 100) \\
%  \{\lambda_t, \lambda_{tx}\} &\sim \textrm{Uniform}(0, 1000) \\
%  \sigma &\sim \textrm{HalfCauchy}(25) \\
%  w_0 &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\lambda_0^2) \\
%  w_x &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\lambda_x^2 \textrm{I}_d) \\
%  w_\rho &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\lambda_\rho^2) \\
%  w_t &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\lambda_t^2) \\
%  w_{tx} &\sim \mathcal{N}(0,\lambda^2_{tx} \textrm{I}_d),
%\end{align*}
%where $I_d$ is the identity matrix of dimension $d$, which is the number of
%control factors. 
%The propensity score, $\rho(x_i)$, is obtained from a logistic
%regression model. We also tested a gradient boosted classifier
%\citep{friedman2001} for this using five-fold nested cross validation.  It did
%not seem to be more performant than the logistic model on held-out log-loss
%score.
For the earnings outcome we use a Normal likelihood, and for the
entrepreneurship outcome we use a Bernoulli likelihood with a logistic sigmoid,
as in Equation (\ref{eq:bayesmods_clf}).
We place hierarchical priors over all model weights, the forms of which we
have detailed in Appendix \ref{app:bayes}.

For model inference, we use the no U-turn MCMC sampler \citep{hoffman2014} in
the numpyro software package \citep{bingham2019, phan2019}. 
% The choice of an
% uniform improper and non-informative prior over the regression weight scales,
% $\lambda_*$, is motivated by the advice in \citet{gelman2006} where we desire a
% non-informative prior that admits large values. We choose a broader 
% prior for the treatment component of the model to minimise bias as suggested by
% \cite{hahn2020}. 
We first burn in the Markov chain for 2,000 samples, then draw
1000 samples from the posterior parameters to approximate the ATE,
\begin{align}
  \hat{ATE}_\text{earnings} &= \frac{1}{Sn} \sum^S_{s=1} \sum^n_{i=1} \tau^{(s)}(x_i), 
  \label{eq:hlrATE} \\
  \hat{ATE}_\text{entrep.} &= \frac{1}{Sn} \sum^S_{s=1} \sum^n_{i=1} 
    \sigma\left(\mu_0^{(s)}(x_i, \rho(x_i)) + \tau^{(s)}(x_i)\right)
    - \sigma\left(\mu_0^{(s)}(x_i, \rho(x_i))\right).
  \label{eq:hlcATE}
\end{align}
where $(s)$ denotes a sample from the posterior parameters has been used to 
construct a random realisation of the treatment model component, and $S = 1000$.

\subsubsection*{Gaussian Process Regression}

Gaussian process (GP) regression can be viewed as a non-linear generalisation
of Bayesian linear regression that makes use of the kernel trick
\citep{williams2006, bishop2006}. Another way of understanding a GP is that it
parameterises a distribution over functions (response surfaces) directly using
kernels, rather than model weights as is the case with Bayesian linear
regression.

To implement the functional relationship in Equation (\ref{eq:bayesmods}) in a
Gaussian process, we create the kernel function over $\langle x, t \rangle$
pairs,
\begin{align*}
  k(\langle x_i, t_i \rangle, \langle x_j, t_j \rangle) 
    = \nu^2_{\mu_0} 
      k_{\mu_0}(\langle x_i, \rho(x_i) \rangle, \langle x_j, \rho(x_j) \rangle) 
    + t_i t_j \cdot [\nu^2_\tau k_\tau(x_i, x_j) + \tau_0].
\end{align*}
Here $k_{\mu_0}$ and $k_\tau$ are the prognostic and treatment kernels
respectively, $\nu_{\mu_0}$ and $\nu_\tau$ allow us to scale the
contribution of these kernels to the functional relationships learned, and
$\tau_0$ permits a constant treatment effect.
%
%Say we have the regression function, $\mathbb{E}[Y|X{=}x_i] = f(x_i)$, a
%Gaussian process models the covariance of $f(x)$ directly using a kernel 
%function,
%\begin{align*}
%  \mathbb{E}[f(x_i) \cdot f(x_j)] &= k(x_i, x_j) \qquad \textrm{or}, \\
%  \mathbb{E}[Y_i \cdot Y_j] &= k(x_i, x_j) + \sigma^2 \delta_{ij},
%\end{align*}
%where $\delta_{ij}$ is a Kroneker delta, and is one if $i=j$, otherwise zero.
%This formulation also assumes $\mathbb{E}[Y] = \mathbb{E}[f(x)] = 0$ for 
%simplicity -- and can be used directly if the outcomes are transformed to be
%zero mean, or we can model an additional mean function (see \citet{williams2006}
%for details). The Gaussian process can be written as,
%\begin{align*}
%  \mathbf{y} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{K} + \sigma \mathbf{I}_n),
%\end{align*}
%where $\mathbf{y} = [y_1, \ldots, y_i, \ldots, y_n]^\top$ is the vector of all
%outcome samples, $\mathbf{K}$ is the covariance matrix with elements
%$\mathbf{K}_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j)$, and $\mathbf{I}_n$ the $n$-dimensional
%identity matrix. 
%
%To implement the functional relationship in Equation (\ref{eq:bayesmods}) in a
%Gaussian process, we create the kernel function over $\langle x, t \rangle$
%pairs,
%\begin{align*}
%  k(\langle x_i, t_i \rangle, \langle x_j, t_j \rangle) 
%    = \sigma^2_{\mu_0} 
%      k_{\mu_0}(\langle x_i, \rho(x_i) \rangle, \langle x_j, \rho(x_j) \rangle) 
%    + t_i t_j \cdot [\sigma^2_\tau k_\tau(x_i, x_j) + \tau_0].
%\end{align*}
%Here $k_{\mu_0}$ and $k_\tau$ are the prognostic and treatment kernels
%respectively, $\sigma_{\mu_0}$ and $\sigma_\tau$ allow us to scale the
%contribution of these kernels to the functional relationships learned, and
%$\tau_0$ permits a constant treatment effect. This induces the functional
%relationship we want; $f(x_i, t_i) = \mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) + \tau(x_i) \cdot
%t_i$. We use the same propensity model for $\rho(x_i)$ as the linear model 
%previously.
%
%We have chosen isotropic Mat\'{e}rn $\frac{3}{2}$ kernel functions for
%$k_{\mu_0}$ and $k_\tau$, 
%\begin{align*}
%  k_{\nu=3/2}(x_i, x_j) = 
%    \left(1 + \frac{\sqrt{3}|x_i - x_j|}{l} \right)
%    \exp\left(\frac{-\sqrt{3}|x_i - x_j|}{l}\right),
%\end{align*}
%where $l$ is the length scale parameter, and controls the width of the kernel
%function. Smaller length scales allow for more high-frequency variation in the
%resulting function $f(x_i)$. The Mat\'{e}rn kernel is a stationary and
%isotropic kernel, but does not have excessive smoothness assumptions on the
%functional forms it can learn -- this kernel leads to the response surface
%being at least once differentiable \citep{williams2006}. 
%
We chose a Gaussian process with a Mat\'{e}rn kernel which can learn non-linear and 
interaction-style relationships between input features and the outcome. The kernel 
parameters are given in Appendix \ref{app:bayes}. 
%Our composite kernel is not
%necessarily stationary however, as we have included a non-stationary term, $t_i
%t_j$. 

%A-priori, we expect reasonably smooth variation $\mathbb{E}[y_i \cdot y_j]$ so
%we choose a long length-scale for the prognostic kernel function, $l_{\mu_0}$ =
%10, and an amplitude, $\sigma^2_{\mu_0} = 1$. We expect an even smoother
%relationship with less contribution for the treatment, and set the
%corresponding kernel parameters as; $l_\tau = 50$, $\sigma^2_\tau = 0.1$ and
%$\tau_0 = .001$. These parameters are then optimised using the maximum
%likelihood type-II procedure outlined in Section 5.4.1 of \citet{williams2006}.

The ATE is approximated as,
\begin{align*}
  \hat{ATE} = \frac{1}{Sn} \sum^S_{s=1}\sum^n_{i=1}
    f^{(s)}_*(x_i, 1) - f^{(s)}_*(x_i, 0),
\end{align*}
where $f^{(s)}_*(x_i, t)$ are samples from the Gaussian process posterior
predictive distribution\footnote{See Equations (2.22)-(2.24)
of \citet{williams2006}.} with kernel inputs $k_*(\langle x_i, t \rangle, \langle x_i, t
\rangle)$, which is equivalent to sampling from the distribution over
$\tau(\cdot)$. We use $S=100$ samples.

Unfortunately inference is more difficult in a Gaussian process that models
the binary entrepreneurship outcome in Equation (\ref{eq:bayesmods_clf}), and
so we must resort to approximation. There are numerous ways we can approximate
a Gaussian process classifier, the most simple of which is to use the hierarchical
Bernoulli-logisitc model from the previous section but to transform the inputs,
$x_i$, with a Nystr\"om basis expansion~\citep{williams2000}. We can then use the same
Monte-Carlo inference proceedure and ATE approximation in Equation (\ref{eq:hlcATE}),
but with $x_i \to \phi(x_i)$ where $\phi$ is the Nystr\"om transformation. We give more
details of this transformation in Appendix \ref{app:bayes}.

\subsubsection*{Bayesian Causal Forests}

The last Bayesian model we use is the Bayesian causal forest introduced in
\citet{hahn2020}. Broadly it models the prognostic and treatment components as
Bayesian additive regression trees (BART). We use the accelerated BART (XBART)
implementation of this algorithm detailed in \citet{krantsevich2022}. BART
\citep{chipman2010} has been shown to be an effective and easily applicable
non-parametric regression technique that requires few assumptions in order to
capture complex relationships that can otherwise confound effect estimation.
ATE is estimated in the same way as for the linear model in Equation
(\ref{eq:hlrATE}), but where the BART posterior is used for the treatment
effect distribution. We give more information about this model in Appendix
\ref{app:bayes}. Unfortunately there exists no implementation of the Bayesian
causal forest for binary outcomes, and so we only use this model for the
earnings outcome.
%,
%\begin{align*}
%y_i &\sim \mathcal{N}\!\left(
%  \mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) + \tau(x_i)\cdot t_i, 
%  \sigma^2\right) 
%  \quad\textrm{where}, \\
%\mu_0(x_i, \rho(x_i)) &= \textrm{BART}(x_i, \rho(x_i)), \\
%\tau(x_i) &= \textrm{BART}(x_i).
%\end{align*}
%We follow \cite{hahn2020} in our choice
%of BART priors,
%\begin{align*}
%  \alpha_{\mu_0} = 0.95,&~
%  \alpha_{\tau} = 0.25, \\
%  \beta_{\mu_0} = 2,&~
%  \beta_{\tau} = 3.
%\end{align*}
%This choice prefers a more simple treatment effect model, $\tau(x_i)$, that is
%less likely to branch, and more likely to have shallower trees 
%than the prognostic model. Similarly, we use 200 trees for the prognostic model,
%and 50 for the treatment. We take 500 burn-in sweeps, and then 2000 sweeps
%to estimate the posterior BART distributions.




\subsection{Model selection and model evaluation}

For the non-Bayesian models we separate the evaluation of the model class and
estimation of the ATE and CATE parameters in two procedures. We evaluate the
predictive capacity of each model class using nested cross-validation. The
procedure is represented in Figure \ref{fig:exp_model}. Here, our aim is to
compare the predictive performance of three model classes: LASSO, Ridge and
Gradient Boosted Regression (GBR). Our second procedure is to estimate the ATE
and CATE parameters. The procedure is represented in Figure
\ref{fig:exp_param}. We use bootstrap sampling (with replacement) to generate
uncertainty estimates for the parameters, which we obtain over several draws of
the same model class, but with model parameter re-fitting.

Focusing on the first procedure, we apply nested cross-validation to evaluate
which model class performs best. In a first step, as Figure 1 shows, we
pre-process the full dataset (containing 3,400 variables) to generate a dataset
with a smaller set of highly predictive features (containing 91 variables). We
apply a supervised machine learning approach with a LASSO model to select our
top 91 predictors of the outcome of interest using outcomes measured in 2006.
Note that in our later estimations of the treatment effect, the outcome is
measured in 2019. We implement this intermediary step in order to reduce the
correlation between variables and eliminate redundant information.

We assume that the top 91\footnote{We were aiming for approximately 100
features, and 91 was the closest we could get the LASSO estimator to select by
changing the value of its regularisation strength.} features that are most
predictive of the outcome in 2006 correlate with the features that would be
most predictive of the outcome in 2019. By choosing to apply this
pseudo-supervised ML approach on the same outcome variable, but measured at a
different time point, we obtain a good indication of the features that are
useful for a model to perform well. Improved model performance here will also
mean that the selected features are likely to represent the important
confounders. We have chosen 2006 to ensure there is no overlap with 2019
outcomes to avoid overfitting issues with subsequent models.\footnote{We do not
compromise predictive performance when we use the selected subset of features
as opposed to the full set of features. For example, the predictive performance
from a Gradient Boosted Tree model that predicts earnings in 2006, using 5-fold
nested cross-validation, is statistically similar between models that use the
91 feature set and the full, 3,400 feature set (with Root Mean-Squared Errors
(RMSEs) of 484.251 and 482.286, respectively). This is a negligible loss in
predictive performance. There is a slightly larger associated loss between the
restricted and full feature sets from models predicting earnings in 2019 (RMSEs
of 843.548 and 831.931, respectively), but this is still not statistically
significant.}

Using the top 91 predictors, we then apply nested cross validation to evaluate
the predictive capacity of each model class (LASSO, Ridge, GBR). First, we
split the data into train and test folds with an 80-20 split. Within the 80
percent train fold we perform 5-fold cross-validation in order to train and
evaluate the performance of each configuration of hyperparameters. We do this
separately for the outcome surface using the treated observations and the
outcome surface using the control observations. From this, we select the models
with the best mean predictive scores. We then evaluate the predictive
performance of the selected model on the holdout test.

We repeat this process ten times (10-outer scores) for each model class. This
allows us to evaluate the performance based on the mean and standard deviation
of these scores. Note that thus far, we have not evaluated any particular
configuration of the model, rather the performance of the model class on random
(without replacement) subsets of data. The nested cross validation procedure
protects us against overfitting when reporting predictive performance, as the
model selection and validation happens on different data.

Table \ref{tab:ncvhos} shows that the GBR is the best performing model class.
It yields the highest out-of-sample R-squared and the lowest MSE. This is true
for both the outcome surfaces separately. As the DR-learner model relies on the same treatment and control outcome surfaces estimated in the T-learner, we do not repeat Table \ref{tab:ncvhos} for the DR results. A further component of the DR model, however, is the propensity score. Here, we implement a regularised logistic regression to predict the likelihood of being treated (to obtain a further degree). Specifically, we use cross validation to fit a Logistic regression and obtain the predictions from the original sample. The holdout performance of the fitted Logistic regression model yields an area under the ROC curve of 0.71.

\subsubsection*{Inference via bootstrapping}

Once we have selected the best performing model class, we turn to the
estimation of the parameters and their associated uncertainty. We use a
bootstrapped validation procedure to capture the uncertainty arising from
model hyperparameter selection in addition to that from estimating parameters
of a fixed model from noisy, finite data. 

%Here, we estimate the same model class on different realisations of the data. 

A common approach to inference in the causal machine learning literature is to use cross-ﬁtting \citep{cherno2018} or sample splitting \citep{athey2019}. However, sample sizes of survey-based data are often not large enough to split the dataset into separate train and test datasets for each model. A suitable alternate procedure is to use bootstrapping. Bootstrap resampling
allows us to estimate variation in the point model parameter estimates. In this
way, we side-step the need to rely on the assumption of asymptotic normality,
and it is more efficient than sample splitting to generate standard errors. In
our bootstrapping procedure, we ensure that the standard errors reflect the
sources of uncertainty stemming from both the selection of the model and the
estimation of the model. As a result, we generate standard errors that avoid
any potential pre-test issues. Appendix \ref{app:boot} describes the bootstrapping procedure in detail.

%A common approach to inference in the causal machine learning literature is to
%use cross-fitting \citep{cherno2018} or sample splitting \citep{athey2019}.
%These methods ensure that the standard errors on the estimators are not
%underestimated because they avoid using the same data point to both select
%hyperparameters of the model and to estimate the parameters of the outcome or
%effect surfaces. 
%% When the same data point is used to perform both tasks then the standard
%% errors would not reflect both the uncertainty stemming from model selection
%% and that which stems from estimating parameters on noisy, finite data. 
%The result of using the same data for model selection and effect estimation is
%that our standard errors would suffer from pre-test bias since the model may
%suffer from overfitting.
%
%Sample splitting and cross-fitting are appropriate when the sample size is
%large. An issue with studies that rely on survey-based data is that sample
%sizes are often not large enough to efficiently use these methods. For example,
%there may not enough data to split the dataset into separate train and test
%datasets for each model such that each of these splits would cover all the
%common and uncommon values of the $X$-features that are observed in the full
%sample. Consequently, the ML models may not find representative functional
%forms for $\mu_0(x)$ and $\mu_1(x)$.
%% If we were to use a training dataset that was insufficiently sized or
%% non-representative, it would be difficult for the ML models to effectively map
%% the $X$-features to the outcome surfaces, $\mu_1(x)$ and $\mu_0(x)$. There
%% would also not be enough data in the test set to effectively estimate the
%% parameters of the model configuration chosen in the train set.
%As a result, our estimate treatment effects are likely to have a large degree
%of uncertainty.


\subsubsection*{Inference for the Bayesian models}

The inference process for the Bayesian models is a little different since the
hyper-paramters of the models are either fixed or selected automatically by the
learning algorithm (maximum likelihood type-II or MCMC). Bayesian inference
procedures tend to afford some protection against over-fitting since they are
parsimonious when choosing posterior distributions over model parameters that
vary from their prior distributions, which induces a natural model complexity
penalty\footnote{This point can be understood more thoroughly by examining the
evidence lower bound in variational Bayesian inference, see Chapter 10 of
\citet{bishop2006}.}. As such, we use all the available data to learn the model
posterior distributions, which we then sample from to form empirical estimates
of the (C)ATE as outlined in the previous section. 


\section{Results}

There are clear entrepreneurial and economic benefits to gaining an additional
qualification in later life (25 years or older). The effects remain strong up
to a decade-and-a-half after course completion. Table \ref{tab:atebsentrep}
shows that re-training lifts the chance an individual becomes self-employed by
approximately 1-2 percentage points. This is consistently estimated across all
the models. In Table \ref{tab:atebsentrep}, we start by comparing regression
model results with a linear probability model (OLS) and that of generalised
linear models (GLMs) that have a Logit and Probit link that specifically
account for the binary nature of entrepreneurship. The linear probability model
and the GLMs are S-learners, in that they simply take the treatment variable as
a single input feature. We find the results based on the marginal effects (the
difference in the predicted probabilities evaluated at $t_i = 1$ and $0$ for
all $i$ with all other $x_i$ unchanged) are consistent across these three
models. This suggests the linearity-in-parameters assumption is valid. We use
regression models for the T-learner and Doubly Robust analyses, and logistic
transformations for the Bayesian models. The T-learner and Doubly Robust models
are relatively similar in terms of magnitude (a 2 percentage point increase in
the probability of entrepreneurship) and statistical significance. The
S-Learners and Bayesian models estimate a slightly smaller effect size, although
their confidence intervals include the values estimated in the former
approaches.

For the outcome of earnings, Table \ref{tab:atebslvl} displays a gain of
approximately \$55-110 per week in gross earnings across the approaches. In
2019, this was roughly 5-8 percent of the average gross weekly earnings of
\$1256.20 for all Australian employees (ABS, 2019; 6345.0 Wage Price Index,
Australia). The effect sizes from the GBR T-Learner model are smaller than that
of the two linear models. GBR better captures non-linearities. For example, age
is likely to exhibit a highly non-linear relationship with earnings in 2019.
Those who were aged 46 or above in 2001 will be aged 65 or above in 2019. This
means they are more likely to have retired by 2019 compared to those who were
aged below 46 in 2001. As a result, we may expect a shift down in earnings at
age 46.\footnote{Age fixed-effects alone are unlikely to capture the
differential age effects across other variables such as across different
occupations, or by gender, and earnings. The linear ML models include age fixed
effects. However, they do not include interactions between age and other
variables whereas GBR does include them. To illustrate how GBR adequately
captures non-linearities we re-estimated our results focusing on those who were
aged 25-45 in 2001. This is the same as interacting a binary variable (for age
25-45) with every other feature in the model. In Appendix Figure
\ref{fig:valadle46}, we see that the results across the models are now more
similar than when we use the full sample.} The Doubly Robust (DR) models
estimate smaller effects compared to the T-learner models. Table
\ref{tab:atebslvl} displays a gain of approximately \$62-69 per week in gross
earnings across the DR approaches. The estimated effect sizes are statistically
different from zero. The confidence intervals for the DR estimates also exclude
the point estimates from the T-Learner approach.

%One reason the DR approach differs from the T-learner approach is that the
%former uses additional information from the propensity score (i.e. we estimate
%machine learning models to gain a better understanding of the treatment
%assignment process, the students’ background, and the nature and complexity of
%their situation that may have led them to pursue further education). Thus, the
%doubly robust approach can improve upon the T-learner approach because it can
%reduce misspecification error either through a correctly specified propensity
%score model or through correctly specified outcome equations. Another feature
%of the Doubly Robust approach is that it places a higher weight on observations
%in the area where the relative count of treatment and control observations is
%more balanced (i.e. the area of overlap). A benefit of this is that it can also
%provide better extrapolations of the predicted outcomes. 

The Bayesian models estimate similar sized effects to the DR models for the
most part. However, they tend to have more uncertainty associated with their
estimates. They all remain significant with the 95\% confidence intervals
remaining above \$0. The hierarchical linear model and the Gaussian process
both estimate a gain of approximately \$61-\$63 per week in gross earnings,
with the Gaussian process being more certain in its estimate. Interestingly,
the Gaussian process prefers a much smoother and smaller treatment effect
component compared to its prognostic component\footnote{The treatment kernel length
scale is long, and the kernel has a small amplitude and offset ($l_\tau = 243$,
$\sigma_\tau^2 = 0.0517^2$, and $\tau_0 = 0.0312^2$) whereas the prognostic
kernel parameters stay relatively close to their initial settings ($l_{\mu_0} =
16$, and $\sigma^2_{\mu_0} = 1.42^2$).}. The Bayesian causal forest estimates a
slightly higher gain of \$84.50 per week in gross earnings, which is more inline
with the GBR T-learner. This suggests that the tree ensemble methods may be
able to more easily capture non-linear relationships than the other models.

%Turning to other measures of earnings, the value-add in earnings (taking the growth in earnings between 2001 and 2019 - all expressed in 2019 terms) is also higher for those who gained an additional qualification, compared to those who did not advance in their education, by approximately \$60-80 per week. As a proportion of the growth in earnings for all Australian employees between 2001 and 2019, this represents 18 percent of the overall growth in earnings. The results are contrasted graphically in Appendix Figure \ref{fig:earnings}.
%
%The similarity in the results between the value-add increase in earnings and the level increase in 2019 earnings suggests that, once we control for background characteristics, we have accounted for inherent or base level differences between those who do and do not obtain an additional qualification. 
%In other words, the difference in 2019 earnings reflects the causal effect of advancing education in later-life.

Proportionate changes in earnings can be measured by taking the log of the earnings measures. In Appendix Figure \ref{fig:valadlelog}, we see that the proportionate change in earnings was large at 50 percent. This is likely to be because of people entering the labour market as a result of the new qualification. We find that a new qualification increases the likelihood of employment by approximately 8 percent (see Figure \ref{fig:empl}).

Acquiring an additional qualification may increase earnings through a number of
potential mechanisms. We find evidence that, in Figure \ref{fig:empl} for
example, it increases the chance that individuals move from being unemployed or
out of the labour force to being employed. The increase in employment is
approximately 8 percentage points and is statistically significant. We also
find evidence pointing to workers switching occupations or industries. This
suggests that further education in later life can support the economic goals of
a larger workforce as well as a more mobile one.

%The largest earnings gains are associated with acquiring an undergraduate degree or above (including Graduate certificates and Graduate diplomas). As displayed in Figure \ref{fig:degree}, only modest gains are associated with secondary or post-secondary certificates or diplomas. More generally, significant earnings gains are achieved when returning students acquire qualifications above those previously held. In fact, the earnings gains are much higher if students advance their qualification status rather than gaining an additional degree at the same or lower level.
%
%The magnitude of the returns to education also differs depending on the type of subject studied. Obtaining a degree in a technical subject is likely to yield a return that is twice as high as obtaining a degree in a nontechnical degree. The returns are statistically significant for the former but estimated with a high variance for the latter. Technical subjects are STEM subjects, medicine, and health-related fields whereas nontechnical subjects encompass those in the creative arts, arts, humanities, and social science disciplines. These results are also displayed in Figure \ref{fig:degree}.

\section{Sub-group Analysis}

Qualification advancements may not benefit individuals in the same way. In this section we analyse if there is heterogeneity in the treatment impacts. We use a data-driven approach to select the sub-groups. Specifically, we identify the important variables for which we expect to see the largest changes in the treatment effects. This involves using a permutation importance procedure.
%
%Last, Figure \ref{fig:wellbeing} shows that there are limited gains in improved mental health or well-being (life satisfaction or job satisfaction) from obtaining an additional qualification.

\subsection{Permutation Importance Feature Selection Method}

We use a permutation importance selection method \citep{breiman2001,molnar2020}
to evaluate the relative importance of individual features. Our aim here is to
understand where the heterogeneous treatment effects are most pronounced. In
other words, we aim to identify the sub-groups for which the treatment effects
differ most significantly. Figures \ref{fig:featgbrDRe} and \ref{fig:featgbrDR} display the top ten features and a residual category for all the other features. In selecting the important features our objective is to understand how to partition the data by the treatment effects as opposed to predicting the outcomes themselves. Appendix \ref{app:perm} describes this procedure in detail.

For entry into entrepreneurship, interestingly, the two most important features are: Age first left home and Do fair share of child care. Together, these two factors explain 27\% of the importance of all the variables. This points to behavioural and childhood factors -- rather than current economic conditions -- being the top determinants of entrepreneurial returns from retraining. Although, the other categories point to more income- and financial-wealth based factors as also being important. 

For earnings, the features that are most important are: weekly gross
wages on the main job and income- or wealth-related variables. Together, this
class of income/wealth variables accounts for 40\% of the importance of all
variables. We focus on these selected features since our Nested CV approach
pointed to the better predictive performance of the GBR model over the linear
models. Other important features include those related to employment, including
occupational status, employment expectations, and employment history. The
demographic background of the individual, namely their age, is also important. 
%Figure \ref{fig:featgbrDRe} displays the top ten features for entry into entrepreneurship

%Appendix Figure \ref{fig:featgbr} reiterates the importance of features related to employment, including occupational status, employment expectations, and employment history. The demographic background of the individual, namely their age, is also important. 

Figures \ref{fig:dengbrlevDR} and \ref{fig:dengbrlevDRe} display the distribution of the MSE importance values across
the bootstrap samples for the GBR model. They display the distributions for the
top 3 features for the respective outcomes. This suggests that in some of the bootstrap samples,
where the MSE is larger, the individual treatment effects from the permuted
data differ greatly from the original individual treatment effects.\todo{I think more  explanation may be needed here? Add some of the permutation importance description from  the appendix back in here.}
%Figure\ref{fig:dengbrlevDRe} displays the distribution of the MSE values for entry into entrepreneurship
%
We present the results for the DR (GBR) model, however, similar features are chosen from the T-learner models. Results are available upon request. 


%However, the LASSO and RIDGE models also demonstrate the importance of other demographic characteristics such as the number of and presence of young children in the household, as well as economic-related variables such as previous educational attainment, amount remaining on the home loan and work aspirations.

% add HTE from DR stacked with T-Learner   Figure \ref{fig:htemldr} 

Figures \ref{fig:htedr} and \ref{fig:htedrent} show that there is heterogeneity in the treatment impacts. We display heterogeneity by features that are both commonly used in such analysis and which are considered most important according to
the permutation procedure. For each feature, we divide the sample into two
groups. For continuous variables, we take the median value and divide the
sample into those who are above and below this median value. 

Larger entrepreneurial gains are achieved when qualifications are acquired at
older ages. Younger learners may be more likely to seek re-training in order to become employees. These age-heterogeneity results contrast with the outcome of earnings, where mature-age learners are less likely to gain.\footnote{Younger people have had more time to accumulate returns and this result aligns with findings from previous studies
\citep{polidano2016,dorsett2016,perales2017.}} This may point to the different aspirations of those mature-age learners who do and do not become entrepreneurs in the late-career stage.  

Weekly personal income has a large impact on the effect size for the outcome of earnings but little impact on whether or not retraining lifts the chance of being an entrepreneur. For earnings, those with below median income in 2001 derive more benefits than those with above median income, possibly because high income earners hit an earnings ceiling. Weekly personal income and age are likely to be highly correlated, with older individuals tending to earn a higher personal income. We cannot say which variable is the main driver of the
heterogeneous treatment effects and there may also be interaction effects between them.

We also investigate if there are heterogeneous treatment effects according to
commonly used variables in Figures \ref{fig:htedr} and \ref{fig:htedrent}. Males are far more likely to reap entrepreneurial gains compared to females when they retrain; whereas females are slightly more likely to reap earnings gains.
Those with resident children are more likely to reap entrepreneurship-rewards when they retrain, compared to those without resident children. For earnings, however, similar treatment effects apply to those with and without a resident children. The gaps in these effects widen when we consider parents who have younger children in the household, although the gap widens in their favour when we consider earnings gains and tends to work against them for entrepreneurship. This suggests that entrepreneurship in the late-career stage involves time-commitments that prevent relatively time-poor individuals (with higher caring responsibilities) from entry -- and that retraining or an additional degree provide less buffer against barriers to entry for them -- compared to those with less caring responsibilities.
%
%The T-learner (GBR) model is mostly consistent with the Doubly Robust model in
%the estimates of the CATEs. Figure \ref{fig:htegbr} shows some differences
%based on age, weekly income and the household income. One reason for the
%larger effects in the Doubly Robust model is that it places more emphasis in
%the areas of overlap compared to the T-learner: there may be few treated
%observations in the extremes of the continuous variables of age and income. 
\
%: women appear to benefit more from later-life study than men (see Figure
%\ref{fig:demo}). The gains to further education for women are likely to stem
%from the process of completing the degree. By contrast, for men, the
%difference in earnings (in 2019) between those who do and do not gain an
%additional qualification appear to emerge due to selection into adult
%learning: men who completed further education had higher earnings prior to
%enrolment compared to men who did not acquire an additional degree. Comparing
%the earnings growth, as opposed to the level differences in 2019 earnings,
%between these two groups of men shows that the value-add of further study is
%much smaller and now statistically insignificant.
%
%Larger earnings gains are also achieved when qualifications are acquired at
%older ages. The value-add of an additional degree for older adult learners is
%more than double that of learners who acquire additional degrees at younger
%ages. This contrasts with findings from previous studies, which show higher
%returns when degrees are acquired at younger ages
%\citep{polidano2016,dorsett2016,perales2017}. A possible reason for the
%difference is that we analyse older Australians and compared to some of these
%studies, we consider a broader range of degree types.
%
%On the face of it, the returns to education appear larger for those with lower
%starting individual earnings in the main job compared to those who start out
%(in 2001) with a higher weekly salary. Specifically, Figure \ref{fig:ses}
%shows that individuals who earn less than the median value (of \$425 per week)
%benefit twice as much from an additional qualification compared to those who
%start out with a salary below the median rate. However, this is largely driven
%by selection effects. Among workers with starting salaries below the median
%rate, those who completed further education had higher earnings prior to
%enrolment compared to those who did not acquire an additional degree. This
%positive selection into further education may arise because the base group of
%those who do not pursue further education includes the long-term unemployed.
%In other words, the value-add of an additional qualification for those who
%start out with lower earnings is smaller once we account for selection
%effects.
%
%Among workers who begin with higher levels of individual earnings i.e., their
%weekly gross earnings in the main job are larger than the median rate, the
%value-add of gaining an additional degree is in fact, larger than the
%comparison of level earnings in 2019. One potential explanation for this is
%that among this group, workers with relatively lower earnings than their
%higher earning counterparts may seek further education in order to improve
%their earnings capacity. By acquiring an additional degree, they successfully
%lift their earnings relative to those who did not obtain further education.



\subsection{Sensitivity Analysis}

We test the sensitivity of our results in two ways. First, we compare the ML models with traditional econometric models such as Fixed Effects, Difference-in-Difference and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) with controls. Following from this, we replicate published work by Chesters (2015) and try to understand the sources of bias in their OLS model compared to the estimated ML models. Second, we recode the input features so they are measured within the 2 years before a person begins re-training (as opposed to 2001 for everyone). In this analysis, we also measure outcomes 4 years after retraining (as opposed to in 2019 for everyone). For both sensitivity analyses, we focus on the outcome of earnings. The Chesters (2015) paper does not look at entrepreneurship and the small samples of people who transition into entrepreneurship limit our ability to use it as an outcome in the latter analysis.


\subsubsection{Comparing results between Machine Learning and Traditional Econometric Models}

The ML models estimate smaller returns than the returns estimated in DD-FE or cross-sectional models (OLS with and without controls) where features have been selected based on theory or previous empirical learnings. For example, the `OLS Baseline model' uses the features in models estimated in Chesters (2015). The DD-FE eliminates all selection effects that are fixed over time. Figure \ref{fig:method} displays the estimated returns from six different approaches.

A potential reason for the smaller results estimated in the ML models is that the additional features included, as well as the non-linear specifications of the features, more effectively account for selection into treatment. The smaller results suggest individuals positively select into further study i.e.~the characteristics that lead one to complete further study are positively correlated to future earnings. Once we control for this upward selection bias, we thus estimate smaller returns to further education.

The smaller estimated results relative to the DD-FE model are likely to stem from the inclusion of key time-varying variables such as the `change in total gross income' in the ML models, as well as other non-linear specifications. For example, the ML models allow the treatment effects to vary in a highly flexible fashion across different parts of the feature distributions rather than making linear extrapolations.

This points to a benefit of using ML models, compared to conventional models, because they can more effectively identify confounders. We show evidence of the types of confounders missed in conventional models in Table \ref{tab:mlvars}, as well as the direction of the bias stemming from their omission. 

In addition, we show evidence that models which allow for more flexible functional-form specifications lead to differences in the ATE. Within our ML models, the GBR tree ensemble tended to perform better (in terms of the nested cv results) compared to the linear-based models. The former yielded a slightly smaller ATE compared to the LASSO and Ridge results, for example, and they were also consistent with results from the Bayesian Causal Forest.



\subsubsection{Missing variables from the baseline model}

As part of a replication exercise, we constrast the results from the ML model with published work using Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Fixed Effects models. We also contrast the features selected in the ML model with an approach that manually selects the variables as in the case of \cite{chesters2015}. We call this the `baseline' model.

As a descriptive exercise, Table \ref{tab:mlvars} presents the features that were `missed' by the baseline model. In the baseline model, we included features such as age, gender, state of residence, household weekly earnings, highest level of education attained, and current work schedule. This collection of variables have been informed by theory or previous empirical results.  

The data-driven model identifies more salient variables compared to the baseline model. Additional variables include employment conditions such as work schedule, casual employment, firm size, tenure or years unemployed; financial measures such as weekly wage, investment income and mortgage debt; health measures such as limited vigorous activity and tobacco expenses; and work-life preferences related to working hours and child care. 

We identify variables as missing from the baseline model if those variables explain the residual variation in the outcome. Specifically, we regress the residuals from the baseline models (without the treatment included) on the features included in the data-driven model and train a LASSO model to highlight the salient variables that were missed. The variables that are chosen are listed in Table \ref{tab:mlvars}. We also document how these variables are correlated to the outcome and to the treatment in order to give us a sense of the direction of the bias their omission may induce. 

Most of the omitted variables bias in the OLS estimates is upwards.\footnote{Exceptions include casual employment status, the presence of a past doctorate qualification, years unemployed, parental child care and dividend and business income.} The upward bias is consistent with the ML-models estimating an economic return of further study that is significantly smaller than the return from an OLS model or a Difference-in-Difference - Fixed Effects (DD-FE)  model. In the DD-FE model, we use the same 5,441 individuals but they are followed over two waves: 2001 and 2019 (i.e. there are 10,882 person-wave observations). We control for individual and wave fixed-effects. 

Figure \ref{fig:method} displays the estimated returns from six different
models. The first three bars show significantly higher returns based on the OLS
(no controls), OLS (with controls) and the DD-FE models compared to the last
three bars, which are based on the ML models -- Gradient Boosted Regression,
Doubly Robust and Bayesian Causal Forest. We discuss these methods in more
detail below. 

It is important to highlight that our approach to identifying missing variables
from the baseline model is a descriptive one. As previously mentioned,
the ML algorithm randomly selects variables that are highly correlated thus we
may have missed out on reporting the label of important variables omitted from
the baseline model.


\subsubsection{Feature Inputs and Outcomes Measured in a Narrower Time Frame Around Re-training}


For sensitivity analysis, we repeated the T-learner estimations using feature
inputs values taken from individuals two years before they began study. Thus, we
examine if our main results are sensitive to changes in the mapping equations
for the treatment and control outcome equations when features are measured
closer to the event of study, compared to taking input values in 2001. We also
measured outcomes four years after study began. This means that the timing
between when the feature input values are measured, when a further degree
commenced and was completed, as well as when the outcomes are measured, are all
closer together. This necessarily leads us to estimate the short-term returns
of obtaining a further degree. 

Our results from the sensitivity analysis are similar to that of the main
results. Specifically, the gains in gross earnings from a further degree in the
sensitivity analysis are: \$74 per week (Ridge), \$117 per week (LASSO) and
\$93 per week (GBR). The key take-away from these results is that the average
treatment effects in the main analysis are not sensitive to whether our
features use 2001 as the input year or use the two years before study. 

Furthermore, the main results are not sensitive to when outcomes are measured
i.e. the returns measured four years after the start of a study spell are
comparable to the returns averaged over 2 to 17 years after study completion.
This may point to the fact that the returns to further study are accrued in the
immediate years following the completion of the degree. It also suggests the
returns may not atrophy over time, especially since the majority of people who
did complete a degree in the main analysis did so in the earlier years of the
survey (Figure \ref{fig:yearcompdeg}). Unfortunately, our sample sizes are not
sufficient to explore heterogeneity in treatment effects by the year of
completion. 

The importance of employment-related features such as earnings (individual and
household), wages, and hours worked are reiterated in the sensitivity analysis
using the panel structure of the data. Namely, when we define our outcomes 4
years after the start of a study spell and where we define features two years
before study started, we also see similar results to that of the main results.
However, in Figure \ref{fig:featgbr_panel}, it is clear that the `trend' or
`growth' in the values of features such as individual earnings, hours worked
and household income are also important. This finding of dynamic selection is
echoed in the literature \citep{jacobson2005, dynarski2016, dynarski2018}. 

In Figure \ref{fig:featgbr_panel}, the feature mental health is also picked.
This result may reflect the fact that the timing of the measurement of
features, treatment and outcomes are all closer together compared to the main
results. This means that mental health is an important factor in explaining the
heterogeneity in relatively `short-term' treatment effects. 


\section{Conclusions}

Using a machine learning based methodology and data from the rich and
representative Household Income and Labour Dynamics Australia survey we have
shown that completing an additional degree later in life can increase the chance of becoming self-employed by 1-2 percentage points. It can also adds \$55-110 (AUD,
2019) per week to an individual's gross earnings, which represents roughly 5-8
percent of the weekly gross earning for the average worker in Australia. Our
machine learning methodology has also uncovered sources of heterogeneity in
this effect.
%, in particular those less than 45 years old tend to reap more benefits than
%others.

We make a significant methodological contribution to the economics literature by undertaking causal inference with machine learning techniques, and we show how these outputs can be interpreted and made into clear recommendations for practitioners.  

Our methodology has allowed us to exploit the full set of background
information on individuals from the HILDA survey, beginning with more than
3,400 variables, to control our analysis. 
% In particular, the key benefits of our automated feature selection process
% include the potential to minimise confounding bias while minimising
% overfitting issues. It can do this by identifying features (and functional
% forms) that may have been previously overlooked or unanticipated.
We find that our automated feature selection method selects a set of
controls/features that include those that have theoretical foundations and/or
align with those chosen in past empirical studies. However, we also choose
features that have been traditionally overlooked. These include variables such
as household debt, wealth, housing, and geographic mobility variables. Other
important predictors include the ages of both resident and non-resident
children: non-resident children aged 15 or above matter and resident children
aged 0-4 are important.

% ML models randomly choose between variables that are highly correlated, which
% means that our selected features do not suggest any causal relationship
% between the features and the outcome. However, as the features act as
% nuisance parameters, helping us to obtain the best prediction of the outcomes
% (or the response surfaces for treatment and control groups), this random
% selection of variables does not compromise our primary aim of obtaining the
% ATE and CATE estimates. We use cross-validation for feature selection.

% For inference, we use bootstrapping (with replacement), generating 100 samples
% to produce a distribution of ATE and CATE values. This allows us to derive
% standard errors for our causal parameters. We also make use of Bayesian models
% that naturally yield posterior predictive densities, which we can sample to
% obtain confidence intervals for ATE estimates.

% There are clear economic benefits to gaining an additional qualification in
% later life. Analysing those who obtain an additional qualification anytime
% between 2002 and 2017, we estimate a gain of approximately \todo{We have to
% still give reasons for not choosing models that fall outside this
% bound.}\$60-80 per week in gross earnings. This represents roughly 7-8 percent
% of the Average Weekly Gross Earning for the average worker in Australia.

%The effects remain strong up to a decade-and-a-half after course completion.
%The largest earnings gains are associated with acquiring an undergraduate
%degree or above. Only modest gains are associated with postsecondary
%certificates or diplomas. Furthermore, the subject-area of study is important:
%undertaking study in technical subjects such as the STEM or medicine and
%health-related disciplines yield significantly higher returns that study in
%the fields of Arts, Humanities or the Social Sciences.

Qualification advancements do not benefit Australian workers in the same way. Those with lower weekly earnings appear to benefit more from later-life study
than those with higher earnings. One possible reason is that ceiling effects
limit the potential returns from additional education. However, for entrepreneurship, the reverse is true: those with lower personal and household earnings tend to benefit less from retraining in later life compared to those with higher earnings. This likely reflects the fact that entrepreneurship requires higher start-up costs, compared to being an employee, and thus higher starting incomes provide a boost to the returns to retraining. We also find that
younger Australians (less than 45 years of age) benefit more than their older
counterparts in terms of earnings gains from education. Similarly to our previous interpretation, a ceiling effect phenomenon may apply since age is highly
correlated to weekly earnings. Again, by contrast, the reverse is true for entrepreneurship where it appears that older individuals are more likely to benefit from retraining.

% ****Dan, do you have other theories about why we see this result? 

Acquiring an additional qualification may increase earnings through a number of potential mechanisms. The first is that it lifts the chance an individual becomes an entrpreneur in later-life. The earnings gains here may arise because becoming self-employed extends one's career into later-retirement. We also find evidence that it increases the chance that individuals move from being unemployed or out of the labour force to being employed, which also aligns with the entrepreneuship channel for individuals who are made unemployed before retirement age. We also find evidence pointing to workers switching occupations or industries. This suggests that further education in later-life can support the economic goals of a larger workforce as well as a more mobile one.

\section{Bootstrapping Procedure}
\label{app:boot}

To estimate the parameters and their associated uncertainty we use a bootstrapped validation procedure.

As a first step we obtain the 91 top predictors from the initial
pre-processing of the full dataset, shown in Figure \ref{fig:exp_param}. That
is, we train a supervised machine learning LASSO model to extract the features
that best predict earnings in 2006.

The second step involves training our models using the 91 top predictors on a
bootstrapped sample, $s$, to select the best models for $\mu^{(s)}_1(x)$ and
$\mu^{(s)}_0(x)$. 
%Within this bootstrap sample, we divide the dataset into five
%folds and perform cross-validation to select the best model configuration.
%Our model configuration is
%trained on subsets of the data, and then evaluated on holdout samples. We
%modify the 5-fold cross validation to ensure bootstrap replicated training data
%does not simultaneously appear in the training and validation set. We perform
%this model selection step within the bootstrapping procedure to capture the
%uncertainty coming from the selection of hyperparameters. If we simply
%re-estimated the same model with a given set of hyperparameters in each
%bootstrap model then the uncertainty is only over the model parameters, and not
%the model choice (e.g.~the GBR tree depth).

%This process allows us to select the best model configurations for the outcome
%surfaces: $\mu _1(x)$ and $\mu _0(x)$.
Third, and once we have these predicted outcome surfaces, $\mu^{(s)}_1(x)$ and
$\mu^{(s)}_0(x)$, we are able to calculate the individual treatment effect,
$\tau(x_i)$, for each person, $i$, in the original sample (not the individuals
from the bootstrap sample) by substituting the values of their features into
the LASSO, Ridge or tree estimators for the outcome surfaces. We can obtain a
sample mean, $\bar{\tau}^{(s)}$, by averaging
$\frac{1}{n}\sum^n_{i{=}1}\tau^{(s)}(x_i)$ using the bootstrapped effect model.
We repeat this procedure over $S=100$ bootstrap samples. This provides an
empirical distribution of $\bar{\tau}$ and $\tau(x_i)$. The grand mean over the
bootstrap sample means, $\bar{\tau}_G = \frac{1}{S} \sum^S_{s{=1}}
\bar{\tau}^{(s)}$, will converge to the sample treatment effect mean. We use
$\bar{\tau}_G$ as an estimate of the ATE, and $\frac{1}{S} \sum^S_{s{=}1}
\tau^{(s)}(x_i)$ as an estimate of the individual CATE. The bootstrap resample
is the same size as the original sample because the variation of the ATE
depends on the size of the sample. Thus, to approximate this variation we need
to use resamples of the same size.

% The main goal of repeating over the bootstrap samples is to capture uncertainty
% coming from the model selection procedure (i.e.\\~the choice of
% hyperparameters) as well as the uncertainty over the model parameters.

% Each bootstrap sample gives us an estimate of the (C)ATE\todo{(C)ATE?}. Across
% 100 bootstrap samples, we have a distribution of (C)ATE estimates. We take the
% standard deviation of these 100 (C)ATE values to obtain the standard error. 

To obtain confidence intervals for the ATE and CATE estimates we use standard
empirical bootstrap confidence interval estimators \citep{efron1986}.

% To obtain the confidence intervals from these samples, we undertake the
% following procedure (e.g. for a 90\% confidence interval):
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Multiply the (C)ATE by two 
% \item Take the 5th and 95th percentile of the (C)ATE
%   distribution empirically from the bootstrap samples
% \item Calculate the bounds of the confidence interval 
% 	\begin{enumerate}
% 	\item Upper bound = Step 1 - 5th percentile 
% 	\item Lower bound = Step 1 - 95th percentile
% 	\end{enumerate}
% \end{enumerate}

% To do this we approximate the critical values of the confidence interval as $\delta^* = \bar{x}^* - \bar{x}$ such that the confidence interval 
% \begin{align*}
% P(\delta_{0.95} \leq \bar{x} - \mu \leq \delta_{0.05} | \mu) \Leftrightarrow P(\bar{x} - \delta_{0.95} \geq \mu \geq \bar{x} - \delta_{0.05} | \mu) = 0.90
% \end{align*}
% can be reduced to $[2\bar{x} -\bar{x}^*_{0.05} , 2\bar{x}
% -\bar{x}^*_{0.95}]$.\todo{I think we need to change the notation here to use
% $\tau$ instead of x and $\mu$ since these are overloaded. Or if this is a
% standard empirical procedure, we can just reference it}

For the DR-learners, similar to the T-learner, we train $\mu_1(x)$ and
$\mu_0(x)$ models across 100 bootstrap samples and weight these outcome
surfaces by the propensity score model, $\rho(x)$, which is estimated using
logistic regression (as described previously).

\section{Permutation Importance Procedure}
\label{app:perm}

The permutation importance procedure involves testing the performance of a
model after permuting the order of samples of each individual feature, thereby
keeping the underlying distribution of that feature intact but breaking the
predictive relationship learned by the model with that feature. The model
performance we are interested in is the one that maps
the features to the individual treatment effects. 

Following this approach, we compute the individual treatment effects. Note that we train the model on the bootstrapped sample but estimate the individual
treatment effects using the feature values for individuals from the original
sample. Thus, for every individual we have a distribution of values of their
individual treatment effects.

After obtaining the individual treatment effects, we train another model that
maps the features to the individual treatment effects. We use cross-validation
to select our hyperparameters and obtain the optimal model. 

Using the original data, we take a single column among the features and
permute the order of the data and calculate a new set of individual treatment
effects. We compare the new and original individual treatment effects (based on
the permuted data and those from the non-permuted data) and calculate the Mean
Squared Errors (MSE). 

We repeat this for all the features, permuting them individually and evaluating
how they change the prediction of the individual treatment effect target.
Features that yield the largest MSEs are likely to be more important than those
features with lower MSEs since permuting those features breaks the
most informative predictive relationships. 

We then repeat the above steps across all the bootstrap samples. Note that a
different bootstrap sample will change the value of the individual treatment
effects since we train different outcome surfaces for $\mu^{(s)}_0(x)$ and
$\mu^{(s)}_1(x)$ for each bootstrap sample.

We embed the permutation importance selection method in a bootstrapping
procedure in order to capture hyperparameter uncertainty. For example, a
different `tree depth' could be chosen between different bootstrap samples.
This would affect the type of non-linear/interaction relationships that would
be captured by the models, which in turn would affect which features turn out
to be important. 

Finally, we obtain an average MSE for each feature, averaged across all
bootstrap samples. This average value allows us to rank the features by their
importance. Again, those with the largest average MSE values are the most
important. We can also evaluate the uncertainty of this estimate since we
obtain a distribution of MSE values across the different bootstrap samples.

\subsection{Sample Selection}

Our analysis sample includes everyone who was 25 or above and not currently studying in 2001, who are observed in both 2001 and 2019 in terms of the outcome and treatment variables. 

We delete any individuals who were currently studying in 2001 if:
\begin{itemize}
  \item They reported currently studying full part or part time for the main survey 
  \item According to the calendar, they have undertaken any full time or part time studies
  \item They are currently receiving Abstudy/Austudy payment or had received these last financial year 
  \item They have cited study as the reason for not looking for work 
\end{itemize}

1078 individuals were deleted after applying this sample exclusion.

The transformation results in a variable that is ranged between 7 and 49. Locus of control measures the degree to which individuals attribute outcomes to internal versus external factors or the extent their welfare are in their own control compared to external circumstances. A higher score indicates having a more external locus of control, which is considered as a favourable personality trait. 

Frequency of reading books in 2012 (\textit{p\textunderscore{}rdf}) records the frequency the individual reads books in 2012, the first year in HILDA for which this information becomes available. This is a proxy for love of learning\footnote{HILDA contains a question on reading newspapers and magazines but we feel that reflects a care for or understanding of current issues more than a love of learning.}. This is a categorical variable encompassing the following frequencies:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Every day or most days (\textit{p\textunderscore{}rdf1}) 
  \item Several times a week (\textit{p\textunderscore{}rdf2}) 
  \item About once a week (\textit{p\textunderscore{}rdf3}) 
  \item 2 or 3 times a month (\textit{p\textunderscore{}rdf4}) 
  \item About once a month (\textit{p\textunderscore{}rdf5}) 
  \item Less than once a month (\textit{p\textunderscore{}rdf6}) 
  \item Never (\textit{p\textunderscore{}rdf7}) 
\end{itemize}

\section{Panel Sample: Sensitivity Analysis}
\label{app:sensitivity}

\subsection{Sample Selection}

\textbf{Treated sample:} For any person in HILDA who ever reported \textit{starting} a degree (determined by taking a person who switches from reporting “not currently studying” in one wave to “currently studying” in the next wave) and/or \textit{completing} a degree, we select their first study event as a treatment observation if it satisfies three other conditions.

They are: (1) at least 21 years old in the starting year of study\footnote{Note that we expanded the age range in this sensitivity analysis to ensure sufficient treatment observations for the estimation of the treatment outcome surfaces.}, (2) they were present in the two years before the start of study (in order to have information on their feature values), (3) there were not currently studying in any of the two years before the starting year of further study (to avoid reverse-causation issues), (4) they completed their further degree and (5) they were present in the survey and had a non-missing outcome 4 years after the start of study. 

If a study event does not satisfy these conditions, we look to the next study event that satisfies these conditions or (if unavailable) delete the person from our sample completely. Conditions (3) and (5) together mean that we analyse a sample of individuals who started their degrees anytime between 2003 and 2015.

In our treated group, 1,814 individuals \textbf{started and completed a further educational degree}. 

\textbf{Control sample:} These are those who had never started retraining throughout HILDA. From these control observations, we assign a time stamp to them for the year the control person theoretically started to study. We do this for every year from 2003 to 2019. This implies that never re-educated individuals can be duplicated and used multiple times. For example, if a control individual is observed throughout the years 2001 to 2016, then they will be a control for the separate treated individuals that started retraining in 2003, in 2004, 2005 and up to 2017 i.e. the control individual will be duplicated 15 times.

There are 60,945 control observations i.e. individuals who never completed a further degree. However, as described above, these are non-unique observations in the sense that a control individual can be duplicated up to 15 times.

On Sickness Allowance/Speical Benefits (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}onsab}) records the individual was on Sickness Allowance/Speical Benefits in the year prior to starting retraining

On Partner Allowance (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}onpa}) records the individual was on Partner Allowance in the year prior to starting retraining

On Parenting Payments (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}onpp}) records the individual was on Parenting Payments in the year prior to starting retraining

\emph{Housing situation}

Mortgage balance (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}hsmgowe}) records the amount still owing on the mortgage that the individual had in the year prior to retraining start. For those without a mortgage or not home owner, the mortgage balance is set to 0. 

Non home owners (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}renter}) records whether the individual was renting or not living in their own homes in the year prior to retraining start.


\emph{Prior Year Outcomes}

Weekly income from all jobs (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}earning}) records the weekly earnings from all jobs for the individual in the year prior to the individual starting their retraining. 

Weekly income from main job (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}wscmei}) records the weekly earnings from the main job for the individual in the year prior to the individual starting their retraining.
 
Weekly working hours (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}wkhr}) records the total number of hours the individual works in all jobs in a week on average in the year prior to the individual started their retraining. Working hours are set to 0 for those not working. 

Real hourly wage (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}rlwage}) records the real hourly wage of the individual in the year prior to the individual starting their retraining, indexed at 2012 price levels. Hourly wages are set to 0 for those not working and set to missing for those reporting working more than 100 hours a week. All wages have then been adjusted up by \$1 to preserve sample size for the logarithm transformation. 

Log hourly wage (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}lnwage}) records the log of  \textit{p1\textunderscore{}rlwage}. 

Mental health (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}ghmh}) records the transformed mental health scores from the aggregation of mental health items of the SF-36 Health Survey, as reported by the individual in the year prior to the individual started their retraining. It ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better mental health.   

Life satisfaction (\textit{p1\textunderscore{}losat}) records the life satisfaction score reported by the individual in the year prior to the individual started their retraining. It ranges from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher life satisfaction. 

\underline{Delta variables}

For all the variables described in the preceding section titled Characteristics in the Year Prior to Retraining Start, we create a further set of change or delta variables. Specifically, each delta variable is the subtracting of the value of a given characteristic in the two years prior to starting retraining from the value of this characteristic in the year prior to retraining start. 

All delta variables are denoted by the d\textunderscore{} prefix. 

\underline{Education-related variables}

Level of retraining completed: Bachelor and above (\textit{bachab}) records whether the individual had completed retraining at bachelor and above. The variable is set to 0 for the control group and missing for those who had completed certificates. 

Level of retraining completed: Below Bachelor (\textit{bbach}) records whether the individual had completed retraining that is below bachelor level. The variable is set to 0 for the control group and missing for those who had completed a bachelor or higher qualification. 

Main field of study: technical degree (\textit{techdeg}) records whether the individual’s main field of study was a technical degree. The variable is set to 0 for the control group and missing for those whose main field of study was a qualitative degree. Technical degrees include:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Natural and physical sciences
  \item Information technology
  \item Engineering and related technologies
  \item Architecture and building
  \item Agriculture, environment and related studies
  \item Medicine
  \item Nursing
  \item Other health-related (e.g. Pharmacy, Dental studies, Rehabilitation therapies, Optical science, Veterinary studies) 
  \item Management and commerce (e.g. Accounting, Business, Sales and marketing, Banking and finance, Office studies) 
  \item Law
\end{itemize}  

Main field of study: qualitative degree (\textit{qualdeg}) records whether the individual’s main field of study was a qualitative degree. The variable is set to 0 for the control group and missing for those whose main field of study was a technical degree. Qualitative degrees include:
\begin{itemize} 
  \item Education
  \item Society and culture (e.g. Economics, Political science, Social work, History, Psychology, Languages, Religion, Sport)
  \item Creative arts
  \item Food, hospitality and personal services
  \item Other
\end{itemize}  

Study duration (\textit{fsddur}) records the total number of waves an individual had spent studying from the start of their first study event counted in our sample. 

Starting Study intensity (\textit{csftsd}) records whether the individual was studying full time or not when they started their retraining. 

Finishing Study intensity (\textit{fsftsd}) records whether the individual was studying full time or not when they completed their retraining. 

\underline{Other variables}

Number of waves in HILDA (\textit{numwave}) records the number of waves in which the respondent has submitted a valid response for the HILDA survey. 

\subsubsection{Variables that are not included in the model}

The unique person identifier (\textit{xwaveid})

Wave started retraining (\textit{icswave}) 

Wave completed retraining (\textit{ifswave}) 

Control group indicator (\textit{control}) 

Started but did not complete retraining between 2003-2017 (\textit{ncomp}) 

Starting year of retraining imputed (\textit{impute}) is a binary indicator for individuals for which we observe their retraining completion but they never reported ever starting retraining and so we had to impute a starting wave for these individuals.  

Started re-educaton in wave 2018/19 (\textit{latestart}) is an indicator for those individuals who had started their retraining in 2018 or 2019.
