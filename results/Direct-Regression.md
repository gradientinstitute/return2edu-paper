# Direct Regression
## Response Model

How well can we predict outcomes $Y$ conditional on treatment $T$ and other covariates $Z$?

### Treatent variables

   - **reduhl**	Completed re-education based on highest level of attainment
   - **redudl**	Completed re-education based on detailed qualifications
   - **redufl**	Completed re-education using highest lvl and detailed qualifications.

### Outcome variables
   - Mental health in 2019 (**mh**). This is the transformed mental health scores from the aggregation of mental health items of the SF-36 Health Survey, as reported by the individual in 2019. It ranges from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating better mental health.  
   - Working hours in 2019 (**wkhr**) records the total number of hours the individual works in all jobs in a week on average. Working hours are set to 0 for those not working. 
   - Hourly Wages in 2019 (**rlwage**) records the average hourly wage for the individualâ€™s main job in 2019. Hourly wages are set to 0 for those not working and set to missing for those reporting working more than 100 hours a week. 
   
#### Columns explicitly excluded
   - **xwaveid** (unique identifier)
   - **p_rcom*** (timing of completion of re-education, proxies treatment) TODO think about how we would include this
   - **p_cotrl** (first avail 2003)
   - **p_rdf*** (first avail 2012)
