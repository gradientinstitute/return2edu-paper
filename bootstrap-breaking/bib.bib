  abstract = {Matching estimators are widely used for the evaluation of programs or treatments. Often researchers use bootstrapping methods for inference. However, no formal justification for the use of the bootstrap has been provided. Here we show that the bootstrap is in general not valid, even in the simple case with a single continuous covariate when the estimator is root-N consistent and asymptotically normally distributed with zero asymptotic bias. Due to the extreme non-smoothness of nearest neighbor matching, the standard conditions for the bootstrap are not satisfied, leading the bootstrap variance to diverge from the actual variance. Simulations confirm the difference between actual and nominal coverage rates for bootstrap confidence intervals predicted by the theoretical calculations. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a root-N consistent and asymptotically normal estimator for which the bootstrap fails to work.},

  abstract = {Propensity score matching, where the propensity scores are estimated in a first step, is widely used for estimating treatment effects. In this context, the naive bootstrap is invalid (Abadie and Imbens, 2008). This paper proposes a novel bootstrap procedure for the propensity score matching estimator, and demonstrates its consistency. The proposed bootstrap is built around the notion of `potential errors', introduced in this paper. Precisely, each observation is associated with two potential error terms, corresponding to each of the potential states treated or control - only one of which is realized. Thus, the variability of the estimator stems not only from the randomness of the potential errors themselves, but also from the probabilistic nature of treatment assignment, which randomly realizes one of the potential error terms. The proposed bootstrap takes both sources of randomness into account by resampling the potential errors as a pair as well as re-assigning new values for the treatments. Simulations and real data examples demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method relative to using the asymptotic distribution for inference, especially when the degree of overlap in propensity scores is poor. General versions of the procedure can also be applied to other causal effect estimators such as inverse probability weighting and propensity score sub-classification, potentially leading to higher order refinements for inference in such contexts.},

This article proposes an asymptotically valid inference method for the matching estimators based on the wild bootstrap. The key idea is to resample not only the regression residuals of treated and untreated observations but also the ones to estimate the average treatment effects. The proposed method is valid even for the case of vector covariates by incorporating the bias correction method in Abadie and Imbens (2011), and is applicable to estimate the average treatment effect and the counterpart for the treated population. A simulation study indicates that our wild bootstrap method is favorably comparable to the asymptotic normal approximation. As an empirical illustration, we apply our bootstrap method to the National Supported Work data.},

  abstract = {When estimating causal effects using observational data, it is desirable to replicate a randomized experiment as closely as possible by obtaining treated and control groups with similar covariate distributions. This goal can often be achieved by choosing well-matched samples of the original treated and control groups, thereby reducing bias due to the covariates. Since the 1970's, work on matching methods has examined how to best choose treated and control subjects for comparison. Matching methods are gaining popularity in fields such as economics, epidemiology, medicine, and political science. However, until now the literature and related advice has been scattered across disciplines. Researchers who are interested in using matching methods\textendash or developing methods related to matching\textendash do not have a single place to turn to learn about past and current research. This paper provides a structure for thinking about matching methods and guidance on their use, coalescing the existing research (both old and new) and providing a summary of where the literature on matching methods is now and where it should be headed.},

  abstract = {The combination of modern machine learning algorithms with the nonparametric bootstrap can enable effective predictions and inferences on Big Observational Data. An increasingly prominent and critical objective in such analyses is to draw causal inferences from the Big Observational Data. A fundamental step in addressing this objective is to design the Big Observational Data prior to the application of machine learning algorithms. The design step directly helps to reduce biases in the causal inferences that arise due to the non-randomized treatment assignment. In particular, performing the design step prior to implementing a machine learning algorithm ensures that subjects in different treatment groups with comparable covariates are subclassified or matched together, which reduces biases due to the confounding of covariates with treatment. However, the application of the traditional nonparametric bootstrap on Big Observational Data requires excessive computational efforts. This is because every bootstrap sample would need to be re-designed under the traditional approach, which can be prohibitive in practice. We propose a design-based bootstrap for deriving causal inferences with reduced bias from the application of machine learning algorithms on Big Observational Data. Our bootstrap procedure operates by resampling from the original designed observational data. It eliminates the need for additional, costly design steps on each bootstrap sample that are performed under the standard nonparametric bootstrap. We demonstrate the computational efficiency of this procedure compared to the traditional nonparametric bootstrap, and its equivalency in terms of confidence interval coverage rates for the average treatment effects, by means of simulation studies and a real-life case study. Ultimately, our procedure enables researchers to effectively use straightforward design procedures to obtain valid causal inferences with reduced computational efforts from the application of machine learning algorithms on Big Observational Data.},
